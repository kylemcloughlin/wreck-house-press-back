   title: "On the bookshelf: Becoming Autism Friendly by Anne Laurie",
  subtitles: "",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body:  "It takes a special town for people across Canada to pack up their belongings and move to a town of 4,000 people, on the southwest coast of Newfoundland and with no traffic lights. This is Channel-Port aux Basques, the first accredited officially accredited autism-friendly town.

The story of Autism Involves Me is a prime example of the old saying “it takes a village to raise a child”. This book quickly acknowledges the lack of support most towns and cities have when it comes to supporting children with autism. However, it also highlights the power and effect of change that can occur when a couple of people have a vision mixed with a passion to better their community turning it into a whole-community effort. They started small with passion and commitment that made their entire town turn heads and want to help to make their town as inclusive as possible. Every effort they made was a victory for the community. In the end, the town understood that children with autism did not have to fit into society, but society itself had to be re-designed for the children.

This book dives into a unique look at local businesses such as bookstores and restaurants and reveals how their intentions of being autism-friendly succeeded. It also provides you with the necessary resources to become more aware of autism and support your town towards autism-friendly accreditation. This book is as heart-warming as it is resourceful since it provides roughly 30 pages of resources and guides that will appeal to community members, parents, children, teachers, support workers, grocery clerks, and hotel owners alike on how we can all be more inclusive for individuals with autism. These guides, from checklists to discussion questions not only help us understand the “what” of autism” but the “how we can do better”. I read this book in one sitting, but I know I will be consulting it again and again for myself and friends.

On one hand, you get to know community members and their hearts for changing their town. One the other hand, you get an excellent grasp on how to make small and big changes for all individuals, both neurotypical and autistic. You finish the book not only feeling like you are part of the community, but you feel more prepared to support children with autism.
I was drawn to Joan Chaisson, the Director and Co-founder of Autism Involves Me. Her special touch was she not only cared for the children but their parents alike. I was left wanting to know more about her. I felt she had more to teach us about her approach to community engagement and getting people to consistently say yes to her. She is mentioned in a few chapters, but I could feel her hard work in every chapter as the backbone of the movement.

I had two questions throughout this book. The first was, “What happens when these children become adults? Will they find solid employment?” Autism Involves Me argues that it is a challenge for all towns and cities including their own to find fulltime employment for adults with disabilities. While the book did not provide a direct answer, I hope the supporters of Autism Involves Me will delegate resources to this cause.
My second question was, “What about children with disabilities who are not autistic? Are they receiving support? This was somewhat answered in chapter 8 from a speech-language pathologist who reminded us that there are children who do not have autism but have special needs, such as down syndrome, need just as much community support. This is a reminder that while we champion for one group, we need to elevate other groups as well. I am left to assume that since the town is quite educated when it comes to the differences and needs of individuals with autism, they are also well-equipped and compassionate enough to support individuals with other disabilities.

I highly recommend this book to all community members, schools, and businesses. All of us can learn a little that can have large effects and this book demonstrates this. Channel-Port aux Basques was never on my radar of “places to visit” but if I one day have the privilege to step foot in Newfoundland, I am certain I will take any detour to see the town for myself.

  title: "Salvation Army serves again",
  subtitles: "The Port aux Basques branch of the Salvation Army fed meals to provincial fire crews battling a week-long blaze in the Codroy Valley region. - © Bert Osmond",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "The Salvation Army has once again stepped forward to provide food for those passing through in service of the Southwest coast, this time bringing food to provincial firefighters as they battle the forest fire that has, to date, burned over 90 hectares near the Overfalls area in Codroy Valley. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when only tractor trailers were venturing on and off the island, volunteers with the Port aux Basques branch of the Salvation Army provided free meals for weeks for the truck drivers.

Corps Officer Maurice Collins explained that the meals are prepared in the new, restaurant grade Salvation Army kitchen by volunteers before being transported by car up to the firefighters.

“We’re met outside the fire area itself by their supervisor. The supervisor takes it and brings it in to the firefighters,” said Collins via phone interview.

Collins estimates that his volunteers are currently feeding a little over a dozen firefighters, including the helicopter and water bomber pilots.

The plan to feed the firefighters supper and extra water came about after the Salvation Army reached out to the Codroy Valley Volunteer Fire Department and soon received confirmation that the fire crews would welcome the offer.

Other members of the public have also reached out to provide raw goods for the meal preparation, but Collins says not everyone is yet aware that the Salvation Army is stepping in to help the firefighters.

“We just put it on Facebook last night. I’ve had quite a response to that of course, and we’re not soliciting donations at all. It’s just that people have dropped them off.”

It’s still unclear how long the blaze may last and how long the fire crews will be on site, but Collins touches base with them every morning to confirm the number of firefighters he’ll feed that evening. As usual, the Salvation Army volunteers are just happy to help.

“They’re really appreciative of what we’re doing for them.”",

  title: "Matador Mining makes progress",
  subtitles: "Gold nugget. - © Dave Varabioff / Pixabay",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Matador Mining, the Australian corporation that is developing the Cape Ray gold mining project in the Southwest coast, provided an e-conference update to that project to members of the media, town council and staff on Monday morning, Aug. 17.
The corporation revealed that it has 12 million dollars to continue exploration this year and next year of the 120 km of Cape Ray shields. The robust project is expected to last for roughly 10 years and produce 10 million ounces of gold.

Although the company operates out of its Perth, Western Australia office, presenters Ian Murray and Keith Bowes say they have brought back many of the same people from last year.

“We have identified all the people needed from the island to make the team.”
Companies from other areas like Gander and St. John’s are also involved in the development.

Last year the company performed field work and some drilling to determine existing resources, but estimate that so far they have really only explored 15 km of the Cape Ray shield, which they have broken down into separate sections for future testing.

The company is also examining what a processing plant would look like in the region, including the mining area, with an eye towards developing what the representatives called a pathway to production. That could even mean demolishing the existing camps to build a new one centered around the gold mine, the run-off area, tailings pond and more.

Also on the To Do list for the company is just getting the permits, licenses and approvals it will need.

One of the hurdles they must face is environmental assessment so as to protect the native flora and fauna. Studies will include potential impact to fish and fish habitat, large mammals such as caribou, birds, surface and groundwater, and even atmospheric study of any noise or lighting and how it will impact the area.

Gold mining involves usage of contaminants such as mercury and cyanide. A buildup of effluent at one of Hope Brook’s holding ponds in the Southwestern part of the province was responsible for the mine’s shutdown in May of 1991, and Matador Mining intends to avoid any possibility of a similar incident.

Giovanni (John) Sferrazza, who is the President and Senior Project Manager for the Environmental Applications Group will help Matador Mining navigate through the environmental part of the project. He said that he was on site to talk to stakeholders directly and make sure they are part of the discussion.

The plan is designed to ensure that the drilled water is properly captured and won’t leach into streams or groundwater, where it can impact flora and fauna, or even end up in the ocean and affect the fishery. He advised that at some point the company may have three drill rigs on site.

Currently Sferrazza is working with the province to determine the exact guidelines the mining operation will have to follow, and that the environmental process itself can take anywhere from three to five years.

“We are in Year 2,” said Sferrazza.

Once the federal and provincial government’s environmental guidelines have been met, the company will host public meetings to address any other concerns.

“We cannot start the project until all agencies approve,” noted Sferrazza, and once that happens the company can focus on permits.

The company has already held consultations with various stakeholders including outfitters, special interest groups and indigenous communities, and will continue to work with the public to mitigate concerns.

Sferrazza believes that the timeline to submit the final environmental assessment at the federal and provincial levels will like take until the end of August 2021, provided the company can take home enough data from this summer’s exploration to put together all of the information required. Under questioning from a member of council, he stated that a realistic date for the beginning of construction is mid to late 2023.

Other questions from various attendees revealed that the preference for a holding site would be near the ferry to ease transport to the site. The plan is to buy products locally and provincially, but the company will still have to bring in specific materials from outside the province.

Port aux Basques council has offered to provide the company with a list of all services and buildings that the town has to offer.

“It would be invaluable,” replied Sferrazza.

Another update on progress of the Cape Ray mining project is anticipated to take place sometime this fall.",

  title: "Vardy's island removal begins assessment",
  subtitles: "A rainbow appears to touch Vardy's island. The tiny island in Port aux Basques harbour is being tested to determine if it can be removed, so that Marine Atlantic and other vessels will have an easier time navigating into port. - © Rosalyn Roy",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "The Port aux Basques harbour might be undergoing a facelift some time in the future. Verdys island has been used to launch celebratory firework displays for years, but that might soon have to change if Marine Atlantic and the town get their way.


“Vardy’s island removal is in the works. In the beginning the town sought ownership for the eventual removal. This is now in the hands of Marine Atlantic. Marine Atlantic in partnership with the town will be seeking the eventual removal of the island,” wrote Mayor John Spencer via e-mail. “Basically it is in the data collection stage before proceeding to the environmental stage before the actual removal occurs. It is all part of an overall harbour improvement strategy to allow for Marine Atlantic vessels to enter and leave the harbour in weather conditions considered less than ideal with the size of vessels and wind conditions. Many of the trip cancellations are prompted by safety in navigating the tight space within the harbour. The whole project will be done utilizing federal funding.”


Heavy equipment was spotted on Vardy’s island only a few weeks ago. 


Marine Atlantic’s corporate communications officer, Darrell Mercer, confirmed that the Crown corporation is proposing the removal of Vardy’s island to improve the navigational elements of the harbour, enhance safety and lessen the impact of challenging weather conditions.


“As part of this process, we are undertaking preliminary due diligence to investigate the geological and environmental aspects of the island,” wrote Mercer via e-mail. “We are currently drilling three holes on the island to understand its rock composition. This preliminary work will help us better understand and prepare for additional work and study should we progress to a future stage of removal.”


The drilling work lasted two days and was conducted by CBCL Ltd. using subcontractors. The next step in the process is to send the samples for detailed analysis, but Mercer cautions that it is premature to put any time frame on the island’s removal or even to know that it is truly possible.


“There is much due diligence that would have to take place involving various stakeholders. We are currently in an initial research stage to understand the geotechnical composition of the island.”",

But there are also unwritten rules governing how we all make purchases or contribute to someone’s work. One example is waiting to purchase something before taking it home from the store. 


When it comes to the newspaper industry, we have our own set of guidelines we all try to follow as well. For us here at Wreckhouse Weekly, we adhere to these rules as a matter of policy.


This can sometimes become quite a challenge just due to the nature of our business. We have to remain impartial and unbiased no matter the topic we are covering or the people involved. We have to offer everyone an equal opportunity to speak and, at the same time, temper that opportunity with discretion. 


It is not the policy of Wreckhouse Weekly – nor most news publications for that matter – to allow an article to be previewed by a member of the public ahead of publication. This would be irreparably damaging to the integrity of the article and remove the impartiality that we strive to maintain. 


We understand that sometimes you just want to know what lines we have selected from your interview to be in the paper, or perhaps you just might want to look at the photograph we took. But the reality is that if we allow even one person to oversee a step in the publishing of an article then our integrity has been compromised.

  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "Launching a newspaper in the current market could be considered madness.

A study by the Local News Research Project estimates that over 250 Canadian news media outlets have closed between 2008 and 2019. Advertising revenues are down as businesses turn to online instead of old-fashioned print media, and mass layoffs of journalists and support personnel by media conglomerates have become routine. The golden era of newspapers is long gone.

And yet...

Independent, locally owned newspapers aren’t just surviving in Canada, they are thriving. The Discourse has delved in depth with fledgling startups from a half dozen provinces to find out exactly why and how, and their findings show that success comes from a commitment to and an almost exclusive focus on local content.

Smaller, hyperlocal papers have found an advantage in exploring stories that larger urban newspapers routinely ignore, such as a focus on municipal council activities or debates about which small town roads will see its potholes repaired each summer and which ones won’t.

That kind of coverage may not matter in a big city market but recent studies have revealed that it matters a great deal more to rural communities.

A whopping 92 percent of respondents to a Ryerson University poll consider community news to be important, and 69 percent consider it very serious if the decline in news reporting results in less local reporting. Similar polls conducted by various groups also support this data.

This is hardly new information, but it has perhaps been forgotten and is only now being rediscovered.

Back in 1967, teacher Evelyn Currie launched this region’s first newspaper which eventually became The Echo. Eventually it got absorbed by a media conglomerate, rebranded, and then sold and resold until a few months ago when the region’s only newspaper finally shuttered its doors.

By then it had no local staff reporter, no local sales representative and it was not being produced locally, though to be fair this had always been the case.

Some lamented its closure, others didn’t and still more pointed out that the newspaper had become irrelevant altogether because of social media and its long dwindling focus on community events and citizens. Who needs a newspaper when you have Facebook?

Here at Wreckhouse Press Inc. we believe that you do.

There are certain inescapable facts when comparing social media to newspapers, which is much like comparing apples to oranges. On the surface they’re both tasty fruit, but beneath the skin they are wildly different.

Anyone can post anything on Facebook and claim it as fact. Whether it is or not is irrelevant for the platform’s purposes, and in fact the more sensational the post is the more attention it is likely to generate.

Social media lacks checks and balances.

You can post a meme on Facebook, watch it catch on like wildfire, and sit back and enjoy the likes or simply the attention of those calling for your head.

There is no editor to drag you, head bowed, into their office demanding to know where in tarnation your facts are to support your outlandish conclusions. Or demanding you get the other side of the story, to speak to all parties involved and dig down to the core of the truth. There’s also no editor to make sure you remain impartial, that you are focused on the community you serve or that you mind the devil, who is always lurking in the details.

Speaking of details, if you’re going to have a local paper focused on local contents, then it stands to reason that the owners should be locals familiar with the area they’re serving.

The Wreckhouse Weekly’s owners are Port aux Basques natives. Their father was a French teacher from Québec who married a woman from East End Channel. They might have grown up in different provinces, but they spent every summer in Newfoundland and relocated back to their hometown eight years ago after realizing big city life no longer suited them.

“I took my son to visit his ancestors at one of the local graveyards, and he grew quiet and introspective,” offers the Wreckhouse Weekly’s new Editor-in-Chief, J. René Roy. “People think newspapers don’t matter anymore, but I would argue the opposite. Over a century after they were born, my ancestors and their lives and what they did and who they were proved so important to my son that the neighbours and I spent hours telling him stories. There were no newspapers back then to properly document their lives or the town, and no Facebook to share a memory about something that happened a couple of years ago. When I am gone, my grandchildren and theirs can look back at not only what I did, but how this town was and learn about the people that lived here.”

A little known fact is that René has experience as an editor, serving as a freelance ghost book editor for various independent authors. As an avid, exacting and critical reader, editing comes naturally to him. He also has training and experience with printing and photography, and has worked as a freelance photographer and delivery agent. You can send your Letters to the Editor to René at rjroy@wreckhousepress.com. 

For his sister, Rosalyn Roy, reporting is also nothing new. She served as the community reporter for two years previously, and since leaving that job she has written two books and is almost finished her third. She also has over two decades of experience as a graphic and layout artist and will be responsible for designing the advertisements and laying out the paper for printing.

“It’s been pointed out to me by previous editors that I spend far too much time just chatting with people I’m trying to interview instead of grilling them, but I make no apologies for that,” she said. “How can I present their point of view or understand where they are coming from without first getting to know who they are and why something matters to them?”
You can send your story ideas, tips and advertising artwork to Rosalyn by emailing rroy@wreckhousepress.com. 

The Wreckhouse Weekly’s salesperson is Thelma Dominey, who hails from Isle aux Morts and has family roots anchored in Grand Bruit. She has experience in sales and office administration with a previous local newspaper.

“I love getting out to talk to people and I like the challenge of sales. It’s important that people know where they can buy local or that a store can order it in so they don’t have to drive hours each way to get something. If I can bridge the gap between retailers and customers to buy local, that just helps the local economy and works to keep jobs in our area.”

You can reach Thelma to discuss advertising opportunities or copy and binding services by emailing her at tdominey@wreckhousepress.com. 

So here we are, three locals starting up a community newspaper focused on local content covering South Branch to Rose Blanche-Harbour Le Cou and LaPoile. We have some experience, some ideas and a lot of hope. This will be hard work and there’s times we’re going to stumble or trip. We ask for your understanding and your help and your guidance.
You can call us crazy if you like.

Just send us a letter, message or text to let us know what you’d like to see in your community newspaper, because it really is your newspaper, your stories and your legacy.
We just work here.",

  title: "Music Row: featuring Gordon Cromier",
  subtitles: "",
  author: "",
  body: "CODROY VALLEY – Gordon Cormier is a much beloved stalwart on the East Coast Music Scene, particularly on the West Coast where he still resides in his native Codroy Valley.

Cormier has been performing since early childhood, onstage at age 4 or 5 at the Chignic lodge.


“I remember in Grade 1, one of the nuns picking me up and taking me out and sitting me in the chair in the hallway and going back in and getting my accordion and said, ‘Now play for recess,’” laughs Cormier. “Music has always been my heart and soul.”


Cormier figures he plays around 17 different instruments, but the accordion was his first love. His latest instrument is the pedal steel guitar and he’s also got a 24 channel state of the art mixing board on the way so he can continue to record music from his home studio for himself, other bands and individual artists.


“It’s a hobby for me. Music is more of a hobby now. I still love to get out and play with the band.”


The band is called The Breeze Band has been together for about a decade and tends to perform mostly for fun, although they did perform at last year’s Strawberry Festival in Deer Lake. 


One of the fiddles in his studio once belonged to his great uncle, Johnny Archie MacDonald.

MacDonald bequeathed the fiddle to Cormier in his will because of one particularly memorable visit to the Cormier home. When MacDonald went to pour a cup of tea, Cormier grabbed the fiddle and started to play.


“I had never picked up a fiddle before but picked it up and started playing a tune called Cock of the North,” recalls Cormier. “He said he’d never seen that before.”


Music runs through the Cormier clan as effortlessly as water flows through the Grand Codroy River. His mother was a MacArthur and that clan has a similar legacy. Cormier’s niece is Mallory Johnson, who is currently being managed by famed country musician Sammy Kershaw.


“When you grow up and it’s all around you, you can’t help but play.”


The family’s music group, The Cormiers, have toured around North America and their achievements include 6 MUSICNL awards and an ECMA (East Coast Music Awards) 2008 nomination as Group of the Year. Gordon Cormier has also performed as a solo artist for the past 35 years and he shows no signs of slowing down.


“I’m putting together a virtual jamboree,” reveals the entertainer. “The festivals are cancelled this year because of COVID-19 and everybody’s hurting because of that, because there’s no live music, and not only the people that love live music are missing that, the musicians are missing having that place to go play and share their talent.”


The Codroy Valley has held an annual folk festival for years, where Cormier not only performs, but also helps run the sound system. With that on hold for 2020, he came up with the idea of the jamboree not only to help musicians and their fans reconnect but also in support of the Minnie White Museum.


White, who passed away in 2002, remains a legendary figurehead and inspiration to Newfoundland and Labrador musicians. During her career she was awarded the Order of Canada, appeared on television programs such as On The Road Again, was inducted into the Newfoundland and Labrador Arts Council Hall of Honour, and was nominated as Instrumental Artist of the Year at the 1995 ECMAs.


The 2020 Codroy Valley Virtual Jamboree will take place on Facebook and YouTube likely nearer the end of August. Cormier wants to keep the focus on the valley area musicians, which he estimates to number around 70 or 80 performers.


“I’ve gone around and videotaped already quite a few different artists,” says Cormier. “I’m up to about 30, 30 or 35 that are in there already, and it’s going to run over a 2 or 3 hour span.”


Viewers will be invited to donate, with half of the funds going to the museum and the other half to the musicians themselves. 


“They normally don’t get paid and they never ask to get paid,” says Cormier. “I’m always looking at ways to push new talent, new music.”


He says many of the musicians have already told him they don’t want to be paid and to put their share of any donations towards the museum instead. Cormier believes the virtual jamboree has the potential to become quite large.


His personal Facebook page where he performs live for one hour on Saturday nights has earned him new fans from around the world, including a lot of the United States, Europe and Australia. He plans to switch his performances to Wednesday evenings soon though. Cormier just hopes the featured musicians will earn some new fans of their own.


“If we’re going to draw people to this area, not only Codroy area but all the way right to Rose Blanche, we need to make more awareness of what we have to offer.”


In a way, COVID-19 has helped Cormier to focus on finding new, original ways to promote valley musicians while still pursuing his own passion. Were it not for the pandemic, he doubts he would have come up with the idea for the virtual jamboree.


“Music has always been my life. It’s not what I do. It’s who I am.”

  title: "MHA Andrew Parsons on new challenges",
  subtitles: "MHA Andrew Parsons (Burgeo - La Poile). - submitted",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – On July 20, Minister of Fisheries and Land Resources Gerry Byrne announced a $100,000 feasibility study to determine live holding, cold storage and transportation at Gander Airport and Port aux Basques for fresh and live seafood products destined for national and international markets.


MHA Andrew Parsons (Burgeo-LaPoile) says he played only an indirect role, and notes that with Marine Atlantic’s ferries docking in the town harbour, it only makes sense to include Port aux Basques in the study.


“There’s only two ways to get it out – by boat and by air,” said Parsons via phone interview. “They’ll do the feasibility study now, which I’m extremely confident will come up positive.”


Parsons says that part of his job is to ‘help nag’ to keep the process moving forward, especially since the reality of COVID-19 has already resulted in delays.


Parsons says the feasibility study, which will likely entail a Request For Proposals (RFP), will determine what would be necessary in terms of physical structures, human resources, and the cost of all materials involved to run such a facility. He hopes to work with government and the town to make the holding facility a reality, which would eventually lead to more jobs to this region.


He concedes the process may be slower than usual.


“Things are naturally delayed. Then you throw in the collapse of the oil industry in many ways. You look at the very extremely frightening, in my opinion, fiscal update that came out of it,” observes Parsons. “In my opinion, it’s going to take a lot of work.”


Heading up the provincial Liberals in undertaking that work will be new party leader Andrew Furey. Parsons has been vocal in his support of Furey. The two have known each other for around a decade.


“This signals to me a new beginning, and like all new beginnings they’re exciting because there’s potential, there’s opportunity,” says Parsons.


But while the MHA may support Furey and be excited for change, he offers a reality check regarding the massive challenges facing this province.


“As much as I support Andrew Furey,” says Parsons, “I think people need to recognize there’s no silver bullet or saviour that’s going to come in and fix this. It requires absolutely everybody and that’s not just elected politicians. I think it’s time for everybody to be cognizant of the situation we’re in.”


Part of that situation involved rethinking how he interacts with the public. Parsons has consistently been an approachable and accessible public servant, but he finds himself now confined to video conferences, telephone calls and emails as opposed to getting out in the district he serves.


“It’s difficult to be a politician because you’re expected to be so outward and shaking hands and slapping backs and kissing babies as they say, and that’s gone.”


If there’s a bright side, it’s that he’s never been more accessible electronically. In some cases, he’s found meetings and video clips more efficient than driving 45 minutes down the coast to tackle projects or problems in person.


“We’re just so used to being so friendly,” he says. “It’s tough because you go around half the time feeling you’re being rude or awkward or don’t know how to be.”


But Parsons says his role as Justice Minister is more suited to remote work.


“I don’t need to be there in person for every decision,” says Parsons. “That’s just the nature of that department. I don’t need to be sitting there at a desk in St. John’s to be effective.”


On a personal level, Parsons admits that his family is dealing with heightened immuno-compromisation in his own household, and like every other parent, he’s also wondering about the resumption of the school year in September before conceding he feels a bit of anxiety.


“I’m like everybody else. I watch the news and wonder about the second wave,” says Parsons. “There’s so many things to consider.”",

  body: "It may not be the usual summer season for Marine Atlantic thanks to COVID19 restrictions, but the ferry service has adapted to ensure that their passengers adhere to provincial and federal guidelines. Summer residents and out of province workers facing challenges to return to Newfoundland have drawn both provincial and national media attention.


What has earned far less notice is the installation of new ticket booths at the Port aux Basques terminal. Currently the Crown corporation is using a combination of both the old and new booths, depending on the volume of traffic.


“This isn’t a regular summer season for us and traffic volumes are much less than we would normally be experiencing,” offers Darrell Mercer via email. Mercer is the Corporate Communications Officer for Marine Atlantic. “When traffic volumes are high, the old booths are processing commercial traffic and the new booths passenger vehicle traffic.”


All of the new booths can handle both passenger and commercial traffic. Even with lighter volumes, just having two sets of booths entering the terminal space is taking a bit of adjustment.


“We are dealing with some space issues regarding the location of the CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) inspection station which does impact some of the booths,” concedes Mercer.


For its part, a media representative for the CFIA clarified that vehicles will continue to be processed as usual at the inspection shed.


“The quarantine inspection station will continue to be used as it is currently and there will be no changes to the onboarding process from a CFIA perspective,” clarified an agency representative via email. “The location of the Marine Atlantic ticket booths does not impact CFIA’s operation in Port aux Basques. The inspection of equipment and vehicles leaving Newfoundland and Labrador will continue to occur at the current quarantine inspection station.”


The CFIA established inspection stations in 1968 in Port aux Basques and in Argentia in 1979 to mitigate the risk and and spread of Potato Wart (PW) and Potato Cyst Nematode (PCN). Potato Wart was first discovered in Newfoundland and Labrador in 1912, while Potato Cyst Nematode was detected in 1965.


Potato wart is a fungus that renders potatoes unfit for human consumption, while the potato cyst nematode is a roundworm pest which feeds on its roots and can cause a crop yield loss of around 60 percent.

  body: "The world has certainly changed, and our small corner of it hasn't been untouched by the pandemic that affected so many parts of our lives. 


It has only been a month or two since The Gulf News and some of its sister papers decided to shut their doors indefinitely, yet it feels like it was a decision that had been coming for quite some time. It was probably around the middle of summer that we at Wreckhouse Press decided to team up and start a new paper. 


You may notice some things are very different than what you are used to.


Gone are the big federal and worldwide stories that you can get everywhere online or on TV. We feel that people who are local need news that is local. That is what matters to us, and we think it's what matters to you. 


Instead we want to offer you information that has an impact on your daily life and our communities, events that are local, and news that is relevant and specific to all of us. 


We also want to bring back some things that were popular in the past but have been absent for quite some time. 


We are talking coverage of local sports, puzzles – heck we might even do a community calendar. We are new to you, and our goal is not only to inform you but to entertain you.  


Gone are the days of news being printed outside and shipped here. This paper is 100 percent locally owned and operated. We want to create jobs locally and create buzz locally. 


We run the Wreckhouse Weekly out of our home.


We are new at running a newspaper, but we are not new to the business. All of us here at Wreckhouse Weekly have a history with the newspaper business and plan to draw on that experience to bring you back to an important resource in any small community – a truly local newspaper. 


I want to thank you for supporting our endeavour, and I welcome any suggestions you may have on content you want to see in the Weekly. While we can’t promise to put in every idea we are asked to, we will try to accommodate and interact with all of the communities we serve, from South Branch to Rose Blanche-Harbour Le Cou and La Poile. 


At the very least, we plan to do our best.",

The birth of a new media outlet within our community during this pandemic is great to witness. To publish a new local newspaper in the midst of so much uncertainty socially, politically and economically speaks volumes for its creators. Communities need local news coverage and Wreckhouse Weekly will fill this void.


As a community, our role will be to support such an initiative. The foundation of any community across this great nation is small business. And now another small business in Port aux Basques has opened its doors.


Port aux Basques supported its first newspaper 53 years ago. It will do so today.


Symbolically, Wreckhouse Weekly is published across the street on Lillington Avenue in the shadows of the home of the late Mrs. Evelyn Currie, the co-founder and co-editor of our first newspaper, The Echo. It is wonderful to see a commitment to local news events back on our streets.


A sincere welcome and congratulations to Wreckhouse Press on your first edition.

  title: "Fire department update",
  subtitles: "The current Port aux Basques pumper truck is around 30 years old and will soon be replaced by a larger truck. - © J. Rene Roy",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The Channel-Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department is anticipating delivery of its new four door pumper truck in late September according to Fire Chief Jerry Musseau. The department had been applying for an upgrade to its 30-year old pumper truck for the past eight to ten years and was granted approval by the provincial government last spring.


The last time the fire department got a new truck there was a ceremony at the fire hall, but with COVID-19 Musseau concedes that is unlikely to happen this time around. He also doesn’t know if the town’s annual Christmas parade, which is hosted by the fire department, and where Santa and Mrs. Claus ride the pumper truck, will even be permitted to take place this year.


Over the summer, the fire department also hired five new firefighters to bring its complement back to its usual 35-member crew. Usually the fire department runs a two-day defensive training program sometime in the spring, but because of the pandemic regulations that training has not yet been completed. Musseau hopes to get the new recruits through the program before the new truck arrives.


“They’ve got to spend two full days – one day in the class and one day in the field,” says the Chief. “Now that we’re down to a Level 2, we’re hoping in the next little while to get that done.”


Until recently, the firefighters weren’t even allowed to enter their own fire hall unless they had to roll out for an emergency and they had to suspend their regular training. In order to protect against possible Coronavirus transmission, responding to calls means wearing their full face masks before even getting into the fire trucks.


“Thank God we didn’t have a lot of calls,” says Musseau.


Also still in the works is the department’s new smokehouse. Outside of the unforeseeable pandemic delays, the structure’s design is still undergoing changes and cost estimates as some materials are proving tricky to source.


“We haven’t finalized a plan of exactly what we want,” says Musseau. “We wanted something with cinderblock but apparently there’s nobody we can find who can come back and say the price to do a cinderblock house. We’re searching for other ideas.”


Once the plans are finalized, the new smokehouse will be constructed at the current training site which houses some old railcars. The cars will have to be removed and the ground landscaped before construction can even begin, which naturally affects the project’s overall budget.


Anyone who wants to submit their name to the list of candidates for the fire department are encouraged to pick up an application at the town office. Musseau says that the most important thing to keep in mind in that becoming a volunteer firefighter is the time required to train and to serve.


“It’s a big commitment to become a firefighter.”",

  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The most recent meeting of Port aux Basques council took place on Monday, July 20. All councillors were in attendance, with proper social distancing measures in effect for members of council and the public. Here are the highlights.


Business owner Greg Sheaves gave a presentation where he reiterated concerns regarding backfilling issues in the Environmentally Protected (EP) zone along Grand Bay West. The current mapping proposal under the new town plan means he is unable to develop an area of land that he would like to and believes it does not actually interfere with the EP zone. Council informed him that he would likely have to apply for an exemption.


Council remains concerned about motorists speeding through town, particularly in the Grand Bay area. They are working with the Port aux Basques detachment of the RCMP to try to curb speeders.


The new municipal depot in the Grand Bay Industrial Park is nearing completion. Mayor John Spencer stated that he would like to see the new camera security system extended to keep an eye on people who are illegally dumping garbage in the cul-de-sac, as that area is usually a mess even shortly after cleanup.


There was also further discussion about garbage throughout the town. Improper trash storage, repeated littering, and refusal by some pet owners to clean up after their dogs is attracting more and more rats, which is in turn prompting more complaints to council. Mayor Spencer would like to see the town’s garbage cans assessed to determine that they all have cans and proper liners.


A petition by cat rescue group In Memory of Shadow to continue its shelter in part of the town industrial space (old fish plan) past the Oct. 31 deadline was denied. Deputy Mayor Todd Strickland pointed out that housing the cats in that space was only supposed to be temporary, and that unfortunately that fact may have been forgotten in the interim. Without going into specifics, council indicated that there were other business endeavours setting up in that space and that the shelter would unfortunately have to find an alternative space by the eviction deadline.


The Grand Bay West trail still needs some repair and maintenance. Council is also toying with the idea of putting an access point to the trail from the Hopedale cul-de-sac near the new municipal depot.

  title: "Tourism drops but outfitter remains optimistic",
  subtitles: "Chris Farrell of Margaree Outfitters has been feeling the COVID-19 crunch. - © J. Rene Roy",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "Chris Farrell estimates that he’s lost about 75 percent of his tourism business thanks to the pandemic. The owner of Margaree Outfitters is currently in his fifth year of operation, which is turning out to be his most challenging one yet, including his first summer on the water.


Although the Southwest Coast hasn’t reported a single case of COVID-19, the provincial health authorities prohibited non-residents from entering, which effectively derailed the tourist season. Prior to the pandemic, Farrell says he was booked solid, but soon began receiving phone calls, emails and social media message cancellations.


“They’ll rebook when everything gets straightened out,” he shrugs. “I’ve got duck hunters booked for 2022.”


Margaree Outfitters offers eider sea duck hunting, cod jigging, shark fishing and boat tours to nearby historic fishing villages. Business has grown consistently enough that Farrell was able to buy a new boat in anticipation of this summer’s tourist season, a 23-foot cabin cruiser called the Jeremiah.


“The duck hunting has been the big thing for me, more than the cod fishing or the boat tours I find,” says Farrell.


He is standing dockside on a mid-morning Sunday, awaiting his second and last couple of fishers for the day, who will bring the entire weekend’s scheduled bookings to a grand total of five people.


The provincial government’s attempt to help by promoting staycation opportunities to Newfoundlanders doesn’t seem to be helping either. Farrell says he’s seen no increase in local traffic, and even the opening of the Atlantic bubble isn’t making a noticeable difference.


“No. I haven’t really had anybody this summer,” he admits. “Every other summer, I’d come here, some days I didn’t know how I was going to fit everybody in.”


Like other tourism based operators, Farrell has taken advantage of a government subsidy program to stay in business until the tourists can come back. He hopes to salvage the fall duck hunting season, or at least some portion of it.


“I’ve still got quite a few bookings for this winter,” says Farrell, pausing for a moment. “But like I said, we don’t know how much worse this is going to get.”


Despite the setback, Farrell is perhaps one of the luckier ones. He still takes out a few locals or tourists when he can, and spends days just enjoying his own boat out on the water. Meanwhile only a short jaunt down the coast to Rose Blanche - Harbour Le Cou reveals that the historic lighthouse attraction remains closed for the season.


“I was talking to a couple of people I had out. They were down the East Coast. They said there were a lot of places not even open. There’s not enough business to have it open,” says Farrell. “Could be years before this all gets going again.”",

  title: "Port aux Basques autism resources entice new families",
  subtitles: "This spring, Port aux Basques welcomed two families who moved here thanks to its reputation for being autism friendly.",
  author: "Wreckhouse Press",
  body: "This spring, Port aux Basques welcomed two families who moved here thanks to its reputation for being autism friendly.


Kayla MacDonald arrived with her partner Gerry McDow and their child Kosten (pictured above left), who is on the autism spectrum, on March 2.


Also newly arrived are Nick and Melissa Barr, who came in two stages with their family. Nick and his oldest daughter, Ryleigh, arrived in April and had to isolate in a house they had bought. They drove from Toronto in a U-Haul with their two cats and everything that they needed. They then had to self-isolate without hydro for two weeks.


Then in June Melissa came with their three other children, Abbie, Nicholas and Ava (pictured above right). Both Nicholas and Ava are on the autism spectrum.


Both families came because they felt Port aux Basques would provide a better life for their children.


“We left Ontario because of our loss of interest living in a big city as well as the cuts the Ontario government made to autism funding. We knew the cuts would severely impact our son‚Äôs future and cause a lot of unneeded stress on our family. We were also growing tired of living in a busy city and were seeking to find a slow paced town close to nature to call our own. Port aux Basques was the perfect fit for all of our family needs,” said MacDonald.


Melissa Barr, who did not know MacDonald previously, was of a similar opinion. 


“Our two youngest children were languishing on a wait list for autism services in Ontario with no end in sight and we also wanted a safer place to live. We knew our children would be safer,happier and would thrive here.”


Both families conducted significant research before they arrived. The MacDonald family did have relatives here but the Barrs did not. Melissa Barr also had to leave her three oldest adult daughters in Toronto. However, their research made the decision much easier to make. 


“Other then our family that lives in Port aux Basques, we found out that the town was an autism friendly town from some videos and news clips that were online created by Autism Involves Me (AIM). After watching these videos over and over and contemplating our current lifestyle, we made our decision. It was an easy one considering how involved the whole community is in helping kids on the spectrum. We knew that this was definitely the place we wanted to raise our family,” said MacDonald.


Barr agreed, saying “When we decided to leave Ontario I Googled ‘best places in Canada to live for children with autism’ and multiple articles came up about Port aux Basques.”

Both maintain that the new reality of COVID-19 has definitely hampered some of their expectations of the town. 


“We wanted to make sure that we had the proper resources in place when we got here, so we contacted the school and coordinators of therapy to let them know we were coming so we could continue with our sons therapy shortly after we got there. Unfortunately, the pandemic was two weeks behind us and everything shut down shortly after we arrived. We were unable to start any type of treatments and get out in the community until now,” explained MacDonald.


However, the citizens of the town are making up for whats been lost due to the pandemic. 

“Everyone has been amazing! When I first was researching I found AIM on Facebook and I was helped a lot. Then when my husband came, the mayor dropped off food for them and so many people checked in and made them feel welcome. When the rest of us came, it was the same – my amazing neighbors, Julie Ingram and Erica have been welcoming and so supportive and become great friends to us,” said Barr.


All the children with autism will continue with the resources that they need such as ABA therapy, one on one academic help in school, student assistant aid in school, occupational therapy and social interaction with other peers.


Both families say that they are feeling encouraged when contemplating the future. 

Barr imagines, “An amazing future where they will be able to do daily things on their own and maybe one day live on their own with some help. But no matter what, I know they will have a way better future than before.” 


MacDonald is already seeing positive changes.


“We see our son growing up being accepted, not bullied, happy, well supported and loved by the community. We’ve already seen that in the little time we’ve been here.”


Both clans are also eager to participate in AIM’s meetings, both private and public. They are eager to share with the community their experiences and to learn from other parents here. They are also telling their friends back in Ontario how much this town has already welcomed them.


MacDonald says of her experience to date, “The best decision we’ve ever made was coming here to Port aux Basques. I strongly support and encourage all my friends and family to take the step and move somewhere where they can live a happy, peaceful and fulfilled life with their family.” 


Barr is already encouraging others to take advantage of her new community.


“I already have a longtime friend who is making the trip soon with her daughter with autism and if anyone else can find a way they should just do it. They will not regret it.”",

  subtitles: "The historic lighthouse at Rose Blanche - Harbour Le Cou remains closed due to COVID-19. - © J. Rene Roy",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "The town council of Rose Blanche - Harbour Le Cou has been busy even in the wake of COVID-19. Here are some of the highlights of their meetings from Jan. to June 2020.


In January, the town Recreation Committee asked to meet with members to discuss the town’s upcoming 50th anniversary next year. Due to COVID-19 the event is currently on hold, but will be re-addressed next year. Some kind of event may still take place, but it’s unlikely to be as big as what the town was originally hoping to host.


There was also concern about ambulance response being unable to get to town during storms. Council reached out to MHA Andrew Parsons and the Department of Transportation and Works to see what could be done to make sure local emergency services can respond to an emergency situation despite weather conditions.


In February council received communication by an unnamed company expressing potential interest in the quartz mine located in Diamond Cove. Council intended to reach out to the local service district at Diamond Cove, but after checking with the Department of Mines, Lands and Natural Resources felt it was way too early to determine anything. Should the company continue to express interest, council will invite them to a meeting with all parties, but to date no further communication has taken place.


At the April meeting, council noted that there was a great deal of garbage and other debris being improperly discarded around town, especially on parking areas such as the one at the historic lighthouse site. Public notices were planned to advise people that littering is prohibited, and that illegal dumping can lead to charges.


In May, Mayor Clayton Durnford reported that residents were bringing forth concerns about seasonal residents. People were informed that exemptions are the purview of the provincial health authorities and that residents not following the guidelines must report it to the province rather than the town.


Harbour Authority began installing signage to let docking vessels know that if they were coming from out of province they would not be permitted onshore, though they would be supplied water. Any persons onboard an out of province vessel were obliged to follow Provincial Health Guidelines and remain onboard to comply with mandatory self-isolation regulations. To date the town has only had one ship visit and it was a Newfoundland vessel.

At the June meeting it was noted that the historic lighthouse and guest kiosks would remain closed for the summer season due to COVID-19 concerns, however the gate remained opened so that visitors could continue to walk the trail.


The Recreation Committee advised that the playground was reopened until 8 p.m. with a student taking care of the daily cleaning. Social distancing guidelines were also posted at the area and on the town’s social media page.


Given that home assessments are down across the entire province, there was some concern noted about the upcoming budget.


The annual firefighter’s ball that had originally been scheduled for Sept. 19 has been postponed and no new date has yet been determined.

  author: "Colby Lillington",
  body: "Welcome to Cooking with Colby!


This month’s recipe is Focaccia bread. Focaccia is an Italian style flat bread used for many things; such as: antipastos, table bread, and it even makes a great snack. A simple olive oil and/or balsamic vinegar goes very well with focaccia, both the bread and the sauces compliment one another tremendously.


Here’s my recipe on how you can make your own Rosemary Focaccia (Focaccia al Rosmarino):


In a stand mixer add (If you do not have a stand mixer just mix by hand in a big bowl until soft dough forms):

1 1/3 cup warm water, preferable 115 F degrees

2 tsp sugar

1 package of active dry yeast.


Let rise for 10-15 minutes.

1 tsp Flaky Kosher salt

4 cups flour

1/3 cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling over 

3 sprigs of rosemary


With mixer running on low gradually add flour and some olive oil, repeat until a soft dough has formed.


Remove dough from bowl on a floured surface and knead for 3-4 minutes. Form into a ball and place in greased bowl. Cover and let rise for 1 hour.


Next punch down dough then place on floured surface and stretch on a parchment lined ½ sheet pan, drizzle with remaining olive oil. 


Let proof for 25 minutes covered with plastic wrap. While proofing preheat oven to 400° F.

Once proofed remove plastic wrap, and use your fingers to press holes all over the dough. Sprinkle chopped fresh rosemary and fresh kosher salt on top of the dough. Bake for 20 minutes.


Once baked remove from pan and place on cooling rack to let cool. Cut off a slice and drizzle olive oil and balsamic vinegar. You have a wonderful snack in itself or as a side option to a traditional pasta option of your liking.

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – When he’s not busy fulfilling his role as Town Manager for Channel-Port aux Basques, Leon MacIsaac also serves as President for the Newfoundland and Labrador chapter of the Canadian Public Works Association (CPWA) and also serves on the Board of Directors. The organization boasts 2250 members across Canada and is associated with the American Public Works Association (APWA).


As its name suggests, the associations are involved with such things as roads, bridges, sidewalks, drinking water, waste water, emergency management, snow removal and a host of other activities.


“Anybody who’s in public works, we try to cover all that off,” said MacIsaac during a recent phone interview. “CPWA and APWA, we’re sort of like the device for public works for all municipalities and cities across Canada and we lobby with Ottawa, and of course the US as well with their Senate, to try and direct as much money as we can towards public works initiatives to improve roads and infrastructure. It does get to be the battle sometimes to try to get that kind of funding.”


The goal is to share new technology, new information, and find different ways to work together to lobby government for funding for public works initiatives.


Town council considers the association’s considerable resources and networking enough that during its last public meeting on Monday, July 20, it voted unanimously that MacIsaac continue serving on the CPWA board.


MacIsaac says he likes to think his role on the board has benefited the town he serves.

“It’s not just my presence. Anybody who’s involved with public works, locally and across the province, we all get together and we go through different ideas and strategies we can use,” explained MacIsaac.


That exchange and constant flow of information allows members to take advantage of each other’s expertise and resources.


“We always say that we don’t know all the answers,” said MacIsaac. “If you’ve come across something, if we don’t know it we’ll find an answer for you, or you may be doing something that we don’t know and we’d like to know what it is.”


Over and above the benefit of being an association member, MacIsaac says he enjoys his role there. There are plenty of subcommittees and resources and networking to keep him busy.


“We’re always looking at new initiatives across Canada. Every year there’s always new technologies coming about or somebody has a new way of doing stuff that we certainly do like to bring some attention to.”


MacIsaac says that the current focus is on more funding initiatives for public works wherever possible, in particular by working closely with American senators, and federal and provincial ministers.


Another benefit to membership is that when a municipality cannot afford to send its representative to a conference for learning and networking, the CPWA can usually offer help to offset costs through the operating fund.


“All that money is always rotated back to the members for their benefit or scholarships for their children or for them to get their own education initiatives up as well.”

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Although she hasn’t been here long, Courtney Pennell says she is very happy after only a month relocating to Port aux Basques.

“I am from the West Coast so it is very close to home and it is a beautiful place to live. This was the type of position I was hoping to have after completing my diploma.”

Originally from Lark Harbour, Pennell began her new job as the first female Superintendent of Public Works for the town in July 20. Her credentials include a Civil Engineering Technology diploma via a three year program offered at the College of the North Atlantic, and a work term at a different municipality.

Pennell says her new co-workers have accepted her with open arms, and town residents have also made her feel very welcome.

“I have not had anything but good experiences so far.”

Pennell cites the upcoming waste water treatment plant as part of her vision for the town. On a personal level she enjoys volleyball and hopes to find a league to join.

Councillor Jim K. Lane says he is pleased with the town’s decision to hire Pennell as the new Superintendent.

“From my observations thus far I find her to be up for the challenge and very interested in her position.”",

  title: "Minnie White's home becomes museum",
  subtitles: "Helen and Russell White are close to fulfilling their vision for the home of legendary musician Minnie White. - © Rosalyn Roy",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "Not far after the turn towards St. Andrews from the TransCanada Highway, a two storey white house sits quietly surrounded by hostas and trees. This was once the home of Minnie White, a legendary West Coast musician and accordion player who received numerous accolades, including the Order of Canada. She appeared on several television programs and performed regularly at The Starlight. Celebrities adored her, and Rick Mercer once visited her here.


Now Minnie’s house is being transformed into a museum that will honour not only her musical legacy, but the heritage and culture of the Codroy Valley where she made her home. The visionaries behind this private museum project are Russell and Helen White, her son and daughter-in-law.


“The house was built in 1937,” says Russell. “The floors are original. The ceilings are all original.”


The two started with the idea of a museum, but they weren’t sure at first what condition the house was in once all of Minnie’s modern renovations were removed.


“Russell gutted the house out from top to bottom,” says Helen.


The pair peeled back flowery wallpaper for months, eventually uncovering the solid wood underneath. The wide, brown painted planks on the floors and the rougher, clear-coated walls and ceilings are a testament to the carpentry skills of the original builders. Now they lend a classic, inviting charm to the museum and complement the treasures that will be put on display.


Helen is a former schoolteacher with a talent for history and antiques, particularly when it comes to Newfoundland and the Codroy area.


“I have a passion for this kind of thing,” says Helen, who has helped out with the heritage displays of past Come Home Year celebrations. “I had a vision for this. I could really see this happening.”


The vision the couple has is to pay tribute to Minnie and her musical legacy, and preserve the region’s heritage and way of life that has all but disappeared.


Now two and a half years after the Whites started, the My Dear Minnie Museum of Heritage and Culture is finally ready to receive its displays. The front entry room will be devoted to Minnie. Displays will include photos, numerous awards, personal letters and her instruments.


“There was a lot of music played in this room,” says Russell. “Well in the summertime, every Sunday afternoon there would be a crowd here – fiddlers, singers, you name it.”


“I think Minnie would love this,” says Helen.


The adjacent room will display the farming heritage of the Codroy Valley. The White homestead has been recognized as a century farm, meaning their family has farmed that land continuously for over a hundred years. Their land is still a functioning farm, just leased to another farmer.


Another room will feature displays centred around the rich commercial and sport fishing heritage of Codroy.


“Codroy is the only ocean going fishing community in the valley,” notes Helen. “So we have space reserved for anything to do with the fishery.”


Another upstairs room has already been transformed into a one-room schoolhouse, much like the one Helen first taught in. In fact, it’s her old teacher’s desk nestled beneath the window between the wood stove and the chalkboard that Russell built and she painted.

And there are plans in the works for the remaining rooms. Preserving their family legacy and the region’s heritage has a practical side too. Aside from offering a glimpse into the region’s past, it reduces waste.


“We saw the need,” says Helen. “There’s more and more of these artifacts ending up in the landfills because people don’t know what to do with them.”


The retired couple have put a lot of sweat equity into the museum, perhaps even more than the financial equity. Russell did most of the work aside from some minor assistance with electricity and plumbing, and of course Helen pitched in too. She’s done her fair share of painting.


That independence and do it yourself practicality has also extended to the financial side of starting up a museum.


They haven’t solicited any financial help towards costs from the government, nor from the Codroy Valley communities. Both are grateful to local musician Gordon Cormier, who intends to help out by raising funds for a donation by hosting a virtual jamboree.


Going it alone financially was a deliberate choice, so that the two could remain in control of their vision for the museum instead of having to deal with committees or oversight.


“It ended up being an expensive hobby,” chuckles Russell.


“But a very interesting hobby,” says Helen. “It’s absolutely a labour of love.”

  title: "Affordable housing proves unaffordable",
  subtitles: "Affordable housing for seniors remains elusive on the Southwest coast. - © Sabine van Erp / Pixabay",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – When MP Gudie Hutchings, MHA Andrew Parsons (Burgeo - La Poile) and members of council announced in early 2018 that Port aux Basques had received one million dollars in funding from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) for an 8-unit affordable housing complex, it seemed the town had finally begun to address this longstanding problem. The demand was so strong that the wait list for seniors and those with mobility issues interested in a unit soon quadrupled well past the proposed capacity.


But two years after the initial announcement, the project hasn’t even begun construction and now it seems all but certain it never will.


Coun. Melvin Keeping, who sits on the board of the Gateway Village Corporation, which applied for, and was granted the funding approval, outlined the project’s financial difficulties in a report at the latest meeting of council on Tuesday, Aug. 18.


The calls for tenders resulted in three bids, all of which were well over the funding announced. The lowest bid came in at slightly over 1.798 million dollars and the remaining two topped the two million dollar mark.


“We could not award the tender because of the significant shortfall,” said Keeping. “There was a possibility of some additional funding in the amount of 250 thousand dollars through CMHC, which still left us with a 550 thousand dollar shortfall.”


Keeping said that despite the best efforts of all parties involved, no additional funding for the remainder could be found. Moreover, while the CMHC did grant an extension past the initial March 2020 deadline to complete the project, the second July timeline has also expired, although Gateway Village has not yet received an official notification to that effect.

“Given the amount, it would place a financial burden on the taxpayers of Channel-Port aux Basques,” said Keeping. “Also, given the unknown financial impact of COVID-19 on the town’s finances and given the deadlines, which have since passed, we find ourselves in a situation where we have no other alternative but to cancel the project.”


On a personal note, Keeping expressed sadness and frustration that the housing project had fallen through.


“I feel that if it were not for the bureaucratic red tape and regulations, there was a possibility that we could achieve the goal of having this constructed.”


He chose not to go into details, but did lament that this would have been a significant first step in addressing a problem that will not go away and will continue to impact many local seniors. In fact, Keeping said the issue played a large part of his campaign when he ran for council during the last election.


“Maybe if there wasn’t COVID during the last six or seven months we could have found the money,” noted the councillor.


Mayor John Spencer admitted his own disappointment that the project wouldn’t proceed, and offered high praise for the work of everyone involved.


“For us to go out now and borrow 600 thousand plus to see this project through? We just can’t afford it,” said Spencer. “From our perspective this project is now done.”


MHA Andrew Parsons (Burgeo - La Poile) admits he feels much the same.


“I’m frustrated. I know it’s been tough,” he said via phone interview. “You put your energy into something and see it not come to fruition is difficult.”


Parsons believes there’s always a silver lining, and it just may prove to be the learning experience itself, what went wrong and how to overcome those hurdles when it comes time to try it again.


“There’s a need, there’s a desire, and there’s obviously funding available,” noted Parsons. “That’s not going to be our last crack at it.”

  body: "Newfoundlanders and Labradorians have done remarkably well in the pandemic of 2020. We have endured tremendous hardships in having our personal well being turned upside down by health care, education, social and economic systems spiralling away from us based on what could happen if we do not prepare. The bottom line is the province, like many other provinces and areas around the globe, was not ready for a virus on a scale never before witnessed or imagined. 


As a municipal leader, early in the crisis I was encouraged to download a provincial PDF document on preparation for a pandemic. That document was last updated in 2009!

Preparations for a surge on a stretched, fragile health care network had to be done. Provincial political leadership was at its finest. However, the collateral damage of measures on the Newfoundland and Labrador society as a whole are yet to be realized.


We do not need a repeat. Schools need to open. Health care needs to address needs beyond pandemic anxiety. Industry needs to restart. Commercial enterprises need a boost in dealing with the new normal. Thank goodness we are getting there. 


Outside of the Caul’s Funeral Home cluster in St. John’s, the absence of the positive virus cases within the province has been somewhat miraculous. Whole regions such as ours – the Southwest corner – have been virus free.


Thank you, residents. Your patience, kindness, and understanding of the need to protect everyones health and safety has been impeccable.


With talk of a possible second wave across the country new measures, following examples from private entities, have to be implemented. Newfoundlanders and Labradorians are tired of living in fear of a virus outbreak. It is now time for the province to step things up to relieve the fear and anxiety by going on the offence to stop any chance of a second wave through a lobby for stricter controls beyond the province.


 Getting to Newfoundland, by the very nature of its geography, is not easy. There are only two ways into the province – by air and by sea. Any virus spread within the province will be travel related.


If Newfoundland is to continue protecting its vulnerable and aged population, open schools and restore social and economic confidence, then strict measures beyond its entry points will have to be heightened. 


Government has a responsibility to its population to ensure there be mandatory testing before individuals enter the province. This can be achieved as demonstrated by private industry.


The last identified positive virus case travelled to Newfoundland by plane. That individual was asymptomatic with no signs or flu-like symptoms. That person was in transition at Canada’s hub for air travel, taking a flight to Newfoundland, lasting hours with possible exposure to everyone on the self-contained air exchange bubble. 


Once disembarking this individual was able to enter through the COVID-19 security measures imposed by our provincial government with relative ease.


Work related. Essential. Allowed to pass ‘Go’. Grab a taxi. No isolation required. Nothing in place at the airport prevented the virus from entering Newfoundland.


It was only after this individual was tested through protective measures of mandatory testing ordered by a private company, conducted by a private lab, that results indicated they were carrying the virus. Immediate 14-day isolation was imposed. 


A subsequent provincial health public announcement of an optimistic tone indicated no need to worry, the virus was contained. This did little to lessen anxiety, for shortly thereafter another positive virus case was discovered, linked to the first traveller.


Go directly to jail. Pass ‘Go’. Do not collect $200. Another 14-day isolation was imposed. Not sure who is picking up the tab but maybe, just maybe, it could be the provincial treasury for out-of-province travellers forced into isolation within the province.


This same scenario has the potential to exist through the only other way to enter the province, which is by sea through Port aux Basques.


Travellers wishing to enter Newfoundland have to pass through similar checks and balances. However, a potential for travel-related virus importation does exist similar to airport entry.


At the moment the provincial enforcement teams are present at Port aux Basques. These individuals carry out their operations with all the due diligence possible as mandated by the province. Job done, and done well! 


So if the checks are in place it must be the balance that needs to be examined.

For example, there is no mandatory testing. There are individuals coming off the vessels that have not met provincial requirements for entry. Actually, there are still individuals entering without any paper work at all.


Once ashore these same travellers are given an opportunity to call what resembles a 1-800 HELP line with salaried provincial employees offering the ‘yea’ or ‘nay’ – thumbs up or thumbs down Roman forum justice. 


For the thumbs down its back to the ferry, or some other measure at possibly the province’s expense. Whatever the case the system is flawed.


Once the vessel docks entry is divided between commercial and non-commercial traffic. All non-commercial passengers are screened, while all commercial traffic is given a free pass.

Regarding commercial traffic, the range can be very broad from the tractor-trailer unit carrying essential food supplies to the individual van transporting computer parts. No screening. No testing. 


All checks on non-commercial traffic happens at the point of entry. Unfortunately, the point of entry is 96 miles across a body of water known as the Cabot Strait.

Federal requirements dictate that no one can be refused entry to the terminal to travel to Newfoundland. Thus the balance is in favour of the traveller. The balance is not in protecting the health and safety of residents of the province. 


Provincial and federal representatives need to lobby for change.


It is not enough to take a temperature at an airport in Toronto, or incur the expense of a screening program attempting to catch the fox in the hen house. These checks need to be carried out long before any points of entry to Newfoundland and Labrador.To avoid the potential for new cases in numbers unmanageable by the health care system we have to do more.",

  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES -Port aux Basques council held their latest meeting at the town fire hall on a wet Thursday afternoon on Aug. 18, 2020. Only Counc. Justin Blackler was not in attendance, as he was still enjoying vacation time. Here are some of the highlights.


Beach parking lot

A delegation of Kyle Lane residents spoke about issues arising from tourists who are camping overnight in the Grand Bay West beach parking lot, including trespassing, harassment and garbage. The residents are seeking a sign that clearly prohibits overnight parking in that lot. Mayor John Spencer observed that many towns and communities have a designated spot for overnight campers and that a local entrepreneur is continuing efforts to establish a campground within the town limits. Until that is completed, council is worried about potentially driving away tourists, which benefits the town financially.


Speeding and safety

The Port aux Basques detachment of the RCMP has been using a speed sign to monitor problem areas around town. Mayor John Spencer said the final report revealed that over 60 per cent of motorists on Grand Bay Road consistently exceeded the posted speed limit. Another motorist was clocked at 108 kph on Grand Bay West Road and another was found to be driving in excess of 90 kph on Regional Street. The RCMP will continue to examine ways to combat speedsters.


“They’re going to bring in a specialized piece of equipment to slow people down,” revealed Spencer, who observed the detachment had also increased early morning patrols but were hampered by people posting their location on Facebook. “They’ve got an unmarked car they use as well, but it doesn’t take long for an unmarked car to become a marked car.”


Post office pothole

Complaints about a large pothole at the entrance to the Canada Post outlet continue to come into the town office, but council insists that the problem isn’t theirs. One resident reported that he was told by Canada Post the town would fix the pothole, but council will send out a letter to the Crown corporation noting that it’s on their lot and they are the ones responsible for fixing it.


Block the bus

Council voted unanimously to donate $100 to Peaceful Communities for its annual Block The Bus campaign. The campaign helps to provide school supplies for approximately 60 families in the Southwest coast region.


Crosswalk caution

In order to comply with municipal regulations regarding distancing, ones near the 50 Plus Club and the corner near The Source were removed and a single one painted across Main Street near the Bank of Montreal and Shoppers Drug Mart. However one resident was prompted to write a letter to council after observing that motorists often do not stop for waiting pedestrians and are usually travelling at excessive speeds in that area. Despite the fact that it may violate regulations, council wants to see the crosswalk near The Source painted back in so that people can choose to cross elsewhere.


Matthews Lane

Council may in fact have already assumed ownership of Matthews Lane, way back in 1943. A resident brought forward a deed that revealed the road, which council had thought was a right of way, is in fact town property and therefore their responsibility. Council will examine the document which may clear up the question of ownership of that road once and for all.


Farmers market

Deputy Mayor Todd Strickland noted that a recent food vendor who set up a temporary point of sale across near the war memorial proved so popular that it took him 15 minutes to gain entry into the hospital parking lot. He suggested and council agreed that it might be worthwhile to examine setting up a vendor’s market at a designated spot somewhere in town, like the train museum parking lot, to ease congestion and help promote more vendors and local artisans to the area.",

  title: "Rat problems plague Port aux Basques",
  subtitles: "A rat munches on some garbage near a storm drain. - © Dorota Wronska / Pixabay",
  author: "Wreckhouse Press",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – “It’s been a summer dealing with rats,” said Mayor John Spencer at the most recent meeting of council on Tuesday, Aug 18.


Spencer has been actively investigating a multitude of complaints from several regions within town to help determine the extent of the rat problem. The mayor cited Grand Bay, Lemmytown and East End Channel as areas of the town where the infestations seem to be getting worse.


Residents have been complaining more frequently about the increased number of rats on their property that are chewing through wooden garbage boxes to get at the bags and leaving a mess in their wake. Even placing multiple traps around a garbage box doesn’t seem to be a particularly effective deterrent. Rats are able to squeeze through even a minuscule opening.


“We had the pest control people go in there and they figure anywhere from 50 to 70 rats,” said Spencer of the Grand Bay infestation.


The rats did consume the poisonous substance entirely, and after that the pest control company reported trapping fewer and younger, smaller rats, but the battle against the vermin continues. Spencer says he has also noticed them on Bay Street near where he lives.

Damaged boxes and bags left out for days prior to collection only serve to exacerbate the situation.


“You’ll notice the garbage is put out there on the curb at least five to six days before pickup,” said the Mayor.


He showed photos that included garbage boxes located next to one of the town’s fire hall, which also contains garbage left out for days prior to collection and which the rats have successfully chewed their way through. Other public and commercial properties were experiencing similar problems.


“I’ve observed people mid-week carrying garbage out, even though the garbage has been picked up already. By Thursday that box is full,” noted Spencer.


One resident who is having more success in the war on rats has installed a new garbage box. It has no slats for rats to squeeze through and tight wire mesh has been placed around the outside and bottom on all sides. The resident has also lined the box with a rubber mat for easy cleaning of spilled contents and to minimize smells that might attract the rodents. In front of the box the resident has also placed a large rat trap.


“He’s got it all figured out,” said Spencer. “He says it works if you put that wire on the outside.”


A local business owner who spoke to the mayor suggested the town was to blame for closing off a sewage outfalls and forced the rats to look for food elsewhere. His commercial garbage box was soon infested.


“I said it might have something to do with that garbage you’ve got in your box,” was Spencer’s quick reply.


The mayor feels the problem is pressing enough to suggest a special rat committee headed up by Coun. Jim K. Lane, but after a brief discussion the matter was handed off to the Public Works Committee, which was instructed to suggest practical solutions to deal with the town’s rat problem. The mayor warned that he wanted recommendations and he wanted them soon, once the committee members had taken the time to thoroughly examine the problem firsthand.


“This is a serious issue,” said Spencer. “These people are tired of the rats in their area.”

  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Rookie firefighters Leo Strickland, Joshua Legge and René Roy have completed their initial required training and will now respond to emergency calls as members of the Channel-Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department.


Chief Jerry Musseau, Captain John Collier, and veteran firefighters Gary Sparkes, Earl LeRiche and Brad Leamon put the three new volunteers through a two-day program of defensive firefighter training that finished on Sunday, Aug. 16.


“It was just fantastic today,” said Chief Musseau. “It’s quite an intensive day and a lot of work to be done in a short time to tell you the truth.”


The three new firefighters learned ladder work such as how to carry people down, hose work such as hookups, breathing apparatus training and how to sweep and clear a burning structure. There were a few surprises for the rookies, including how to use the fire hose to ventilate smoke from a room.


The Chief had nothing but praise for his new crew members, noting that none of them backed away from what is a tough challenge.


“It went pretty smooth,” said Musseau. “I guess they got comfortable once they got used to wearing the equipment and using it around a fire scene and through a smoke-filled environment, and the more they’re going to use it the more comfortable they’re going to be, but they’ve all done well I must say.”


“It was very good,” agreed Legge. “It was about what I expected.”


Initially the department had chosen five new volunteers to add to their roster, but two resigned prior to the defensive firefighting testing.


“They weren’t able to come to the training and this is a mandatory training,” said Musseau. “It’s not for everybody.”


Normally the department avoids this kind of training during the hot summer months, but the complication of COVID-19 necessitated some unavoidable rescheduling that resulted in delays. Now that they are full fledged firefighters, the rookies will continue to learn via the regularly scheduled two-week department training sessions, assuming there are no further pandemic prompted delays.


They’ll also have an opportunity to train for emergencies that might require the Jaws of Life or even Hazmat, which the Chief says is on the radar. There’s a prerequisite training program first, but provided there is enough interest from the region’s departments the five-day Hazmat training will be scheduled.


“We’re hoping to get that moving in early fall, provided we’ve got the interest,” confirmed Musseau.


When the new pumper truck arrives in late September, the entire fire department will receive training on its operation from the Fire Commissioner.


The Port aux Basques detachment has a standing mutual aid agreement with other departments along the Southwest Coast, from Codroy Valley to Rose Blanche-Harbour Le Cou.


Despite reports to the contrary, the Port aux Basques detachment was not dispatched last weekend to help with the Codroy Valley fire, which is being battled by the provincial forestry department.

  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "On Sunday, August 30, Robert (Bob) Bragg will turn 90 years old. The Port aux Basques native recalls that back when he was growing up children had to “find their own fun”, which he concedes is likely considered unsafe by modern standards.


Those were the days he and some friends spent sunny days running across the roof of the old red shed at the CNR and jumping into the harbour for a swim, or perhaps they would just go swimming in Grand Bay Bottom. As he grew older, Bragg would enjoy a quiet Friday night but on Saturday he would go out in search of adventure, which usually meant venturing to the Royal Canadian Legion or playing cards.


“When playing cards we would play until we raised the blinds to see the sun, which was around 6 a.m. We would go home then and get dressed to go to church.”


Bragg also enjoyed playing badminton in the basement of the United Church, and in the winter it was hockey, which meant taking the train to play games in St. George’s, Stephenville or Corner Brook.


That first summer after finishing high school he joined a ship called The Christmas Seal for the summer. The ship was on a mission to sail around Newfoundland to care for people who had tuberculosis. Realizing this was not what he wanted to do, he returned to dry land and took a job with W. Pike & Sons, a wholesaler and retailer.


Having found something he enjoyed, he started his own business called R. Bragg Wholesale in 1967, distributed for Dominion and Jockey Club Beer, and developed a subdivision called Browning Harvey Co. Ltd. which sold Pepsi products.


He met his wife Shirley while delivering wholesale goods to Tom Windsor’s Store and asked her to go to a movie. They are still married 67 years later. He has saved her twice from drowning, having earned his Red Cross certification in St. John’s in 1957. He also saved another local man.


Bob and his friend had been snowmobiling when the friend plummeted over a huge waterfall. Bob recalls that all he could see was the end of the skidoo sticking out of the water, and eventually found his friend 200 or 300 feet away, clinging to a chunk of ice. Bob threw a rope down and dragged him back to shore, recalling that his friend’s clothing was frozen solid to his body.


A passing motorist helped the pair get back home, but even with a hot stove and blankets the friend couldn’t seem to stop shivering. Bob went to the liquour store and bought a 40 ounce of Old Sam, then mixed the liquour with boiling water.


“By the time I left he wasn’t shivering!” grins Bob.


He says he has taught many children to swim at Edna’s Pond. Together the couple raised three children of their own.


“My kids were in church, school and hockey. They did things outside all the time,” says Bob.

In 1976 he sold the business he built from the ground up to semi-retire, selling wholesale or retail from the back of a truck for a friend in North Sydney or for business owner Harry Anderson. By age 70 the semi-retirement became full retirement and he began taking trips to Florida and the Caribbean.


These days Bob still keeps active, fishing for cod almost every single day he can. He figures he’s only missed a couple of days and that’s only because of the weather. He likes to jig his own fish, then clean and fillet them too.


“I go out because I enjoy it. I get up at 5:30 in the morning, sometimes earlier to turn off the alarm so it won’t wake Shirley. I am at the boat, waiting for my buddy to arrive.”


Some of Bob’s community tenure includes a stint on the town council for 4 years, and 25 years as a Mason. He is a lifelong member of the United Church congregation and the only living chartered member of the Port aux Basques Lion’s Club. He says it’s really nice when the Lion’s Club asks him to join them for their special dinners.


Nowadays Bob and Shirley live in one of the cottages next to the community hospital. He is pleased with what the present day town council is doing and feels fortunate to live where he does.


“I am living very comfortably and I wish the town could provide more such cottages or apartments for seniors,” says Bob, before offering a tip to the younger generation. “You have to get an education and look after the funds for your own retirement plan. You cannot expect others to do that for you anymore.”

  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – A section of High Street near Midway Road has been unpaved for quite some time, and Town Manager Leon MacIsaac says the town is currently waiting on availability of asphalt contractors to complete the job.


The repair work was part of the Taylor’s Lane - Anderson’s Lane stormwater upgrades project. Taylor’s Lane was completed last year, and Anderson’s Lane is the section currently awaiting completion.


 “Both parts of the project included excavating existing roadways, replacement of existing stormwater piping and then reinstatement of roadworks. Both portions of the project also included construction of large drop manhole structures, which are visible from the TCH (TransCanada Highway) below,” stated MacIsaac via e-mail.


All of the work coincides with the upcoming Grand Bay Bottom Sanitary Sewer project. Existing sanitary sewer lines, which were connected to the stormwater system, have been relocated to a dedicated sanitary system and will be connected to a treatment system on the Grand Bay Bottom project.


When asked about the recurring cost of maintaining the gravel section, MacIsaac replied, “As with any project, maintenance and upkeep of the gravel roadway is taken into consideration until asphalt can be applied.” 


Port aux Basques does have an asphalt recycler machine for small patchwork, but it is unable to handle the work for larger jobs such as the one in question.


As for when the rough section might get paved, MacIsaac wrote that the latest information he received points to the first week of September, adding “We are several hours from the nearest asphalt contractor and have to wait until they arrive in the area in order to have paving completed. This is typical every year unless we are fortunate to have the Department of Transportation and Works completing large contracts in the area.”

  title: "Building their dream in Cape Anguille",
  subtitles: "Marilyn and Adam Sarzen are building their dream business overlooking the Cape Anguille lighthouse.",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "CAPE ANGUILLE – To bring a dream to fruition means a lot of hard work, as Marilyn and Adam Sarzen can testify. The couple are the owner/operators of Scenic View Cabins and Adventures, located not far past the Cape Anguille lighthouse.


“He’s always had that idea in his mind,” says Marilyn.


The couple sourced a specific area to build their dream business. Initially Adam says he was trying to get a piece of land from his father, but once this particular plot became available in 2016 they snapped it up. A quick glance around and it’s not hard to understand why.


Nestled on a mountainside, four wood cabins offer magnificent views of the nearby wetlands, farmlands, lighthouse, ocean and wildlife. Nearby trails lead up the mountain for those seeking a long walk or perhaps a few berries to pick while they stroll along miles of cliffs. Anyone who brings along an ATV or snowmobile has plenty of terrain to enjoy riding.


Adam started building the cabins in summer of 2017, and they only officially opened this July. One of the cabins is fully wheelchair accessible, and the fourth cabin is nearing completion. The cabins are also designed to accommodate winter tourists.


“We’ve had guests on the weekend, but obviously this is going to be a slower start for us,” says Marilyn.


Like most tourism businesses, they’ve been challenged by COVID-19. The cancelled reservations have been offset somewhat by provincial staycation visitors, but Marilyn admits they haven’t really focused much on advertising yet.


“We’ve got a little plan here,” says Adam, which upon closer inspection seems to be a massive understatement.


Although they’re still working on the last of the cabins, they’re also building an office check-in and a takeout shack. It’s being built further down the road before the cabins, closer to the red and white lighthouse, and will offer outdoor dining on a huge deck.


The menu will offer fish and chips, and since the fish plant is only just down the road it promises to be fresh daily. Other takeout staples will be burgers and chicken. Given the remote location, it only makes sense to offer somewhere guests can dine on evenings they don’t feel like cooking. They hope to have the takeout open by next spring.


Since they’re already taking bookings for next year, the timing is perfect.


“The only problem I find is that when people call to book I’ve got to say, ‘Sorry but we’re outside the cell service area.’ That’s a killer right there,” offers Marilyn. “We’re going to hook up wi-fi up there so they can still send messages or whatever. Some people don’t like the fact that there’s no cell phone service. Some more people think hey, it’s great.”


As for the adventure part of the Scenic View Cabins and Adventures, the couple say they’re still figuring out the details, but that’s definitely in the works too.


“Hard to say,” chuckles Adam. “I’ve got adventures coming. That’s the last piece of the puzzle.”",

  subtitles: "Tourists who camp overnight in the Grand Bay West beach parking lot are posing problems for nearby residents. - submitted",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Residents near Grand Bay West beach are tired of tourists camping out in the beach parking lot.


“It’s a parking lot, not a campground,” says Lynn Jamieson, whose lives on Kyle Lane, the narrow road that leads to the beach and parking area.


Jamieson, the group’s spokesperson, says the problem is not the tourists who use the beach for day fun, but campers who use the parking lot as a free campsite.


“The issues we had last summer was just unbelievable,” says Jamieson.


She says that some overnight campers have been rude, and have been spotted littering and trespassing despite signs warning they were on private property. The area residents have been reaching out to the town since last September, and have met with Mayor John Spencer and the Public Works Committee, but believe they aren’t making much progress.


Long before the development of Grand Bay West beach as a tourist attraction, Jamieson maintains that a sign prohibiting overnight parking was posted in the area. Before the boardwalk was put in there wasn’t even a proper parking lot, just a sandy spot adjacent to the beach.


“They had horseback rides there,” recalls Jamieson. “There was a sign down there on the post by the fence that said ‘No Overnight Camping Permitted.’”


Although beach area residents are happy to see more people visiting the area, Jamieson believes that the town’s advertisements on the Marine Atlantic ferries along with traffic signs promoting the beach to tourists have had an unintended, adverse effect.


“We never had any issues whatsoever until last summer when they started advertising,” says Jamieson.


In 2018, the town council invited feedback on developing the beach area by hosting public meetings, offering a forum for concerns, as well as suggestions and improvements. The responses led to construction of washrooms and a light to help discourage vandalism. On May 11 the residents sent a letter of their own, outlining multiple major complaints about tourists camping overnight.


Among them were concerns that area campgrounds might take a financial hit because tourists were choosing to camp for free in the parking lot instead, campers hogging multiple parking spots, littering and its impact on the wetlands and protected wildlife, trespassing on private property, invasion of residents’ privacy, confrontations with residents over noise issues, and prohibiting local children from biking in the parking lot.


“It is affecting tourism because they’re not going to the campgrounds so they’re not putting any money back into the town,” maintains Jamieson. “They fill up their vehicles with gas and food before they even get on that boat to come here.”


Council subsequently mailed out a reply granting some requests, such as the installation of additional Doggie Bag stations, plans to further expand the parking lot and trail repairs. However, the petition to install a new sign prohibiting overnight parking was denied. In the letter, the Town cited the positive and direct economic benefit of tourists.


“Currently, an available campground or RV parking is not available within the Town limits. Until such accommodations are available, Council will not post signage or discourage tourists from using facilities at Grand Bay West Beach,” wrote the Town.


Council re-iterated that stance during its Aug. 18 meeting, when Jamieson outlined the resident’s concerns in person.


“I respectfully did not agree with you that people don’t spend money,” responded Coun. Jim Lane. “Tourists wherever they park, whether it be up on the campground or there, they spend money in town, so we’re trying to draw that in.”


By allowing visitors to overnight on the parking lot, Lane says Council is trying to minimize the potential loss of tourism dollars because there currently exists no alternative within Town limits.


Lane also spoke about ongoing efforts by someone trying to build a private campground within town limits.


“We received documentation that we were preventing one of the local entrepreneurs from – we were giving him a hard time with regards to his trailer park,” said Lane, pointing out that the town does not actually want a campground at the beach. “What we’re trying to do is get through to give this gentleman time to get his up and running. That’s the whole intent for us.”


He refuted the claim that Council was hindering the entrepreneur’s efforts.


“We’ve done everything possible that he needed done, at any given time, to get his trailer park ready, and we were told last year that this park should be ready by this year, but it’s not. Apparently it’s not,” said Lane. “We’ve been checking from time to time.”


He did not dispute that residents were experiencing issues with the campers, but stated that he could only share the Town’s perspective.


Coun. Melvin Keeping shared that the Town has looked at developing its own site for overnight camping, but halted efforts in that regard once the entrepreneur revealed similar plans. Should no private campground materialize, council may re-examine developing its own dedicated campsite. 


Mayor Spencer made inquiries surrounding signs being put up prohibiting overnight camping, and shared that another local found a letter on their windshield telling them they shouldn’t be camping overnight. While Jamieson had no knowledge of the signs, another member of the group claimed responsibility.


Although the signs were posted on private property, Spencer said he was going to pass the matter over for investigation, but MacIsaac noted, “You can’t put up a sign without a permit from the town, whether it’s on your property or anywhere else. Without a permit from us, we’ll have to issue an order for removal.”


In a separate interview, Jamieson stated that she has even reached out to the Department of Municipal Affairs and Environment without success, and says she has also sent a letter to the Minister of Tourism, Culture, Industry and Innovation. 


A spokesperson for the province responded to inquiries surrounding the protected wetlands and bird habitats via e-mail.


“The Department of Environment, Climate Change and Municipalities has not received any complaints regarding campers in the area of Grand Bay West. Matters related to camping and potential litter concerns within a boundary should be directed to the town office.”


In 2000, Town Council under Mayor Aneitha Sheaves did draft a bylaw prohibiting overnight RV camping near the ASIL building after complaints about potential revenue losses and environmental concerns over unauthorized graywater dumping by a nearby campground owner and members of the Chamber of Commerce.

  body: "Being an avid fisherman, I will try for trout, cod, mackerel, and most other fish you can find in our region. 


As you might expect, this means I do a significant amount of hiking along ponds, lakes and overland into the wilds. There are some incredible, underrated sights in this beautiful region of ours that not many others get to see, but among those sights that I love, I also see things that cause nothing but distress. 


You know where this is going – garbage. 


I have been a resident of the Southwest coast for about five years now, having moved back to my hometown from the big city to relax and enjoy nature. But I would say that there is not a single pond, lake, brook or trail that I have visited, that isn't polluted by our indifference. 


I have seen entire washer and dryer sets thrown by a brook, cast iron stoves sitting in a pond. Beer cans, plastic bags and shotgun shells run along trails more frequently than the wildlife does. Wrappers, coffee cups, fishing gear packaging are quite literally everywhere I go. 


It is both infuriating and heartbreaking. 


Like you, I see all the posts on our local social media groups calling out the cups and fast food waste we see in town. And like you, it irritates me to no end to know that a person cant even wait for the drive time it takes them to get home or to swing over to a public garbage can to dispose of it properly. 


When it comes to being out in nature, no matter where you go, it takes preparation. I am a firm believer in the “take in take out” philosophy.


If I carry it into the woods, it comes back out. So I carry two bags with me anytime I head off for the day. It takes a moment of thought to put a plastic bag in your backpack or even to put a worm container in your basket, yet it seems that I now consider myself lucky if I have a day where I don't see garbage when I go fishing.


I haven't had a lucky day in quite a while. 


We all need to do better. We all need to take 20 or 30 seconds and pick up what we have dropped or soon there won’t be a clean place to throw a line anymore.


So please make that small effort, and reap the reward of knowing you've helped everyone, including the avid fishers, outfitters and nature lovers in the generations to follow.

After written requests, the executive from the Port aux Basques Lion’s Club, which runs the lottery, chose two organizations to partner with after first conducting interviews.


One factor was how many hours and dedicated people from the partners could be counted on to reliably volunteer each week for a full year. Also, each organization had to have a contact person who could pitch in on quick notice. This year the Lion’s Club Executive chose AIM (Autism Involves Me) and For the Love of Paws, a local cat rescue group.


Monies from the draw will help the Lion’s Club fix a wall in the building and help people within the community. AIM plans to use its share to purchase materials and resources to enable children and adults with challenges to be able to live more complete livelihoods. For the Love of Paws Group will use funds to pay ongoing vet bills among other operational costs.


Players will have to choose a new number to participate. To reduce the amount of possible germs being spread, each yellow card will have an attachment holding stickers for 52 weeks. Players will have to mark their number on the sticker at home and then drop it in one of the provided boxes at a sponsor store. Once a player signs a card, that number is his/her number for the full year.


The new yellow cards will become available for purchase at participating businesses on Tuesday, Sept. 1, and the first draw will be held live on Monday, Sept. 7 at 7:30 pm via the Goldrush 2020-2021 Facebook page.

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – As reported from the Port aux Basques Council Highlights in the Aug. 24, 2020 edition of the Wreckhouse Weekly, speeding and safety has become a major issue with council, the RCMP and area residents.


Cpl. Colin Helm of the Port aux Basques RCMP detachment has been in meetings with Town Council to discuss the speeding issue and determine what preventive action can be taken.


“Speeding has always been an issue. However, we have noticed since the snow left, there has been an increase in reports about speeding in town,” stated Cpl. Helm.


Over the last couple of months a speed sign has been positioned in different areas of town. This sign is a great tool to use in determining where and when the police can put more enforcement.


The sign records the date, the hour, the location, the correct speed limit, total vehicles passing the sign during that hour, average number of vehicles for the hour, total violations, percentage of violations, minimum speed, maximum speed and average speed.


One example of this would be in Grand Bay West, where the posted speed limit is 30 kph.

On Aug. 3, between 2 and 3 a.m., 26 cars passed this sign. There were 22 violations with the maximum speed recorded at 108 kph and an average speed of 45 kph. The minimum speed was 5 kph.


Mayor John Spencer noted in the last council meeting that no one would be expecting a vehicle to be moving at 108 kph in this area and combined with darkness an accident is sure to happen if this continues.


Data from this sign has also shown that the three major areas where excessive speeding occurs are Grand Bay East near the mall, Grand Bay West and the lower end of LeGrow Street. However, there are other areas as well.


“We do have other areas of concern but we will be strategic of where and why we setup in those locations,” said Cpl. Helm.


The local RCMP detachment will soon receive a much desired tool to help in their work when a radar known as the LiDAR system finally arrives.


Police LiDAR is a device that uses the principles of reflection to calculate distances between the device and the vehicle and then uses this information to calculate the speed of the vehicle, even at extremely high speed. It uses laser technology.


The police LiDAR emits infrared laser beams that travel at nearly the speed of light when it hits a vehicle. The laser beam is then bounced back to the device at the same speed. Even for a professional driver, there is very little chance for one to slam on the brakes and slow down enough to avoid detection.


One of the many advantages of the police LiDAR device is that it shoots a very tiny “cone” of light from the gun. This means that the laser is able to pinpoint a specific vehicle without offering any prior warning. This small diameter allows the police officer to target only that one vehicle to obtain a reading. This is how police officers are able to get the information they need. 


As Cpl. Helm stated, “The people running the LIDAR will see you before you see them. Once I get this tool, it will open Pandora’s box“.


Upon reflection, Cpl. Helm feels that we have been very fortunate that no major accidents have yet occurred, and he attributes some of this to the number of people who do drive at the correct speeds in the low speed zones. Also, there is just is one major route going downtown which can become congested, especially when tourists are visiting.


Helm cautions that with school opening soon, there will be a increase of police officers working in areas where students will be boarding or departing the buses.


“I want to remind the public to be cognizant when travelling in a school zone, driving near buses and bus stops. We encourage people who witness a traffic violation to contact us here at the Port aux Basques RCMP detachment.”

  subtitles: "Andrew Parsons leaves the Justice portfolio to become the province’s first Minister of Industry, Energy and Technology. - submitted",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – MHA Andrew Parsons (Burgeo - La Poile) has become the province’s first Minister of Industry, Energy and Technology. New Premier and Liberal Party Leader Andrew Furey appointed Parsons to the brand new portfolio during his swearing in ceremony on Wednesday, Aug. 19. Although Parsons will no longer serve as Justice Minister, he will continue on in his capacity as the province’s Attorney General.


“I’m happy because it allows me to keep a connection to that department and that work which I enjoy,” said Parsons via phone interview. “I’m joining this new department, which is basically a combination of former Natural Resources, combined with components of what was formerly Tourism, Culture, Innovation and Industry. So basically it’s the tech sector, business sector coming over together.”


Parsons says they’re still trying to figure out just who is coming over from what department, and that the physical space logistics still have to be sorted.


“It’s exciting because it’s a big department. It’s got some really massive files, so personally speaking, it’s pretty humbling when the Premier thinks that you’re the guy to help take on offshore oil, the completion of Muskrat Falls, rate mitigation and the tech sector, which is probably the fastest growing and most important thing we have that we can expand,” offered Parsons.


When he was offered the portfolio, Parsons admits he didn’t ask a lot of questions initially, but now he has a very good and general idea of how the department works, and the players involved. Within hours of being handed the portfolio, he reached out to industry leaders and other ministers.


“So work has already started. I already know the big issues, but it’s like anything. You’ve got to get in there, get your head wrapped around it and learn the intricacies and the nuances and the current status.”


Among his primary concerns is the status of the offshore oil and gas industry.


“You can’t overstate its importance to our province, and they have gone through a hugely tumultuous last number of months, and to me how that industry goes is how our province is going to go,” stated Parsons. “At the same time, realizing that we’re moving into a new world with green tech and clean energy, and how do we position ourselves here to take that on? We’re competing against the rest of the world. We’ve got a huge, strong tech industry here where that can play a role in taking this oil industry and gas industry into the future.”


Parsons said that marrying the two under one portfolio is, to his personal knowledge at least, being perceived as a positive step by the public. He believes that the two industries don’t really need to be in opposition.


“We all know where the future is and that is in green energy and clean tech,” said the Minister, “but to do that doesn’t mean that you forsake what has kept this province running for the last number of years, and which is still necessary. You don’t turn a switch.”


The merging of old and new technologies will present new opportunities within the province. That will also come with a steep learning curve for Parsons, but he has a bit of experience under his belt in such situations.


“When I first started with Justice, I always it equated it to drinking from the fire hose. There’s so much information to process, so many people to meet,” offers Parsons. “But five years in you’ve got that done. You’re much more able to run your department because that hard work is done. So in this case it’s the same thing. I’ve got a hell of a lot of reading and listening and reviewing and studying to do now to get myself where I need to be.”


As for his district priorities, Parsons promises that he will continue to remain at the forefront of his efforts. That includes helping any way he can to facilitate the study surrounding the viability of a live and cold storage facility in Port aux Basques.


“You must never forget who allows you to do the job, and if I can do something that’s going to benefit our area, I’m going to do it.”

  subtitles: "For the Love of Paws and In Memory of Shadow Rescue groups are looking for new homes for their cats and themselves.",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Two rescue groups, In Memory of Shadow Rescue and For the Love of Paws, are in a struggle with Port-aux-Basques Town Council when it comes to requesting an area for new shelters.


In Memory of Shadow Rescue was established on February 26 , 2016. In February of 2019, when the trailer that they were using became dilapidated, council gave the group a temporary location in the building known as the former fish plant. The Town has since sent a notice that they need their space back for future business plans and the group has to be vacated from the building by Oct. 31.


For the Love of Paws Rescue started operating in March, founded by a group of prior rescuers. Currently this group relies on foster families for their animals and a large number of the cats are being housed in Loretta and Eugene Battiste’s house in MacDougall’s Gulch, where there are no restrictions on how many animals they are allowed to have. 


Both groups feel that they are very much needed in Port aux Basques.


Velda Tapp-Pretty, spokesperson for Shadow Rescue stated, “To date we have an intake sheet of almost 400 cats. Some are not on the list but we’re working to have every animal counted so it will be close to 500. We have roughly 40 adults needing homes.”


Peggy Savery, a director with For the Love of Paws said, “Since March we have adopted out almost 25 kittens/cats and rescued up to 50-60. Considering at this point we do not have a building this is very good but we would be able to do much more if we had a shelter. Our main focus is the Port aux Basques area. There are still lots of needs locally that are not being met. We deal mostly with cats, but no animal would be denied support.”


In Memory of Shadow Rescue has brought animals in from Rose Blanche to South Branch. Both groups also work with SPCAs in different locations and they are able to transfer animals to other provinces in Canada.


Both groups rely heavily on fundraising to care for their animals.


When asking for land in the town, both groups developed a plan. The In Memory of Shadow Rescue group would like to to build a small shelter and add to it a TNR (trap/neuter/release) barn.


Tapp-Pretty explained, “Not all animals we bring in are easily rehabilitated so they will have access to the barn style shelter designed to be vertical like a tower with a feeding station inside”.


The For the Love of Paws group is very fortunate in that they have a financial supporter who is willing to purchase a place for their shelter.


Savery states, “We just need a place to rebuild or even just a piece of land.”


The Town Council understand how important these groups are, but according to Town Manager Leon MacIsaac, the current regulations lack areas in its municipal zoning where shelters could be erected. The Town currently has one Land Use Zone, Rural, which includes “Animal” (animal pounds, kennels, etc) as a Discretionary Use zone. There are also a number of Rural Land Use Zones throughout the Town. However, municipal services are not readily available at these locations as they were not intended to be currently serviced for development. 


MacIssac clarified there is the possibility for the groups to request an amendment to the municipality regulations but this can be costly and timely.


“The process to make an amendment to the Municipal Plan and Development Regulations can be a bit lengthy, depending on the application, and can cost approximately $4,000 - $5,000 to complete. The application is made through the services of a Professional Planner who would create the text for the amendment and/or required plans for submission. The Town is required to have a Public Hearing, a Public Meeting and advertise all material associated with the application. Unfortunately, it is not a simple matter of making a request and changing the regulations to permit a specific use.”


Presently both groups are still hoping that something can be arranged with the town. They know that there are a number of buildings in the town which may be taken over by Council.

Tapp-Pretty responded to the municipal guidelines by saying, “There are very few rescues who give second chances to an adult cat so that leaves us in a bad place right now. All shelters are full in Newfoundland because of the huge cat population.“


Savery is hoping that the lines of communication will stay open.


'We will continue to try to get their support. We just need the town to see us as a benefit to our community and support our organization.'


It does seem that at least a few residents who are open to having a shelter in their neighbourhood.


Says Felicia Walters, 'I would be thrilled to have a cat shelter in my neighbourhood. It’s much needed in this area. I’m an animal lover and having a building close would entice me to stop in often to lend a helping hand or spend time helping rehabilitate cats who need human interaction to prepare them for adoption.'

  subtitles: "Julia Coates is looking after her parents Codroy vegetable farm while they take their first vacation in 20 years - © Rosalyn Roy",
  body: "From big city Toronto to a hobby farm in the Codroy Valley isn’t that long a trip for Julia Coates. She’s been coming here since she was a baby and her parents, Judy and Harry Coates, were still living and working in Corner Brook. This summer she’s come back to work the farm for six or seven weeks so that her parents can take their first real vacation in roughly 20 years, and she loves it enough that she’s already decided to retire nearby.


“I work for an IT company,” says Julia. “I just sit on computers all day long.”


Now that she’s working her parents farm, she only does that in the afternoon. In the morning she’s out weeding or picking, and she takes care of the little produce stand near the end of the driveway. She greets neighbours and passersby who stop to buy fresh goods, recording the sales in a notebook and taking phone numbers for a specific order if she runs out of the day’s offering.


Today she’s got the stand loaded with zucchini, fat and foot long and fresh from the garden. There’s also pumpkin, cucumber and snow peas left, but she’s run out of beets because someone already bought the whole lot.


Her parents run the stand on an honour system. They’ve slotted a hole in the top of a cleaned out cottage cheese container, listed prices on a child’s drawing board, and trust that anyone who grabs some of their vegetables will leave the money.


“I love it,” says Julia. “You know you actually accomplish something? I sit in conference calls all day long and it gets monotonous.”


She says she’s learned to tend the crops in the morning, and how to properly harvest them, but there’s more yet she still wants to learn. Julia has been coming here every summer for at least the last 10 years.


“I cry when I go home.”


She straps on headphones in the morning while she plucks weeds from the multiple gardens, and she’s also brought help from Toronto. As if on cue, her boyfriend wanders out of the house, jumps in the ATV and heads across the road to tend to the fields.


Julia says it’s good for the soul.


The couple are already planning to build their own house on the hillside behind her parents two-storey farmhouse in a couple of years. They haven’t started construction yet, but they’ve got it all figured out. Julia plans to help her mother with the farm full time.

Harry and Judy retired about 20 years ago, and after touring Europe and North America realized they wanted to retire to their Codroy Valley farm. That’s when they committed to remodelling the farmhouse and restarting the garden.


In addition to the vegetables on the stand, Harry and Judy also grow pears, apples, corn, onions, potatoes, cabbage, turnip and carrots. Some years there is also cauliflower. Because that apparently doesn’t keep her busy enough, Judy is also the organist for the Anglican church in Codroy.


Julia says her mother always wanted to retire to a place with a garden.


Judy's garden is on the larger side. She’s even got a bright, colourful flower garden in full bloom in front of the house. On a sign not far from the stand there’s a sign recognizing the farm for its commitment to sustainable agriculture. Currently the farmers are working to design a drip irrigation system for the farm.


Harry used to work for the school board as a superintendent in charge of bussing and that came in handy when he tore the windows out of some old school buses to build two greenhouses. He even tore the windows out of an old bus left to rot nearby and repurposed those into his greenhouse too. One of them has a fishing net thrown across its roof, and on the outside of the other there’s still a legible emergency exit. Both are filled with and surrounded by various plants, including lettuce, canola, parsnips and tomatoes.


“That’s the only way you’re going to grow tomatoes around here,” offers Julia. “Dad doesn’t throw anything away. I’ve seen him undo a twist tie on some of the beets to use on a trellis for the raspberries.”


Judy likes to turn the raspberries into jam. Julia figures she’s picking about four cups a day of the tasty berry. Another customer drives up and Julia says that it’s pretty steady on the weekend.


“We’re knocking it out of the park.”

  subtitles: "Regis Cornale holds a codfish she caught during a trip to NL.- Port aux Basques Marine Excursion",
  body: "ROSE BLANCHE - HARBOUR LE COU – A lack of transparency when determining who was granted a travel exemption into the province remains confusing for some residents of the Southwest Coast.


Regis Cornale lives primarily in Ontario but also owns a summer home in Rose Blanche - Harbour Le Cou and therefore pays property taxes in Newfoundland.


“I really think the process could have been handled better,” admits Regis, who is in the process of planning the trip home.


Regis usually arrives in June, and last year didn’t leave until after Guy Fawkes Day. When the travel restrictions were first announced, Regis understood the logic and became resigned to the disappointment of not being able to enjoy an annual summer vacation.


“Coronavirus is not something to play around with,” notes Regis. “But then, when I learned that some of my neighbours had been allowed in, I wondered what had changed.”


Since Regis owned a house to comply with isolation for the mandatory 14 days, and excited by the possibility of coming home after all, Regis applied for a travel exemption on July 21. On Aug. 10 that application was denied and Regis appealed it the next day, but then was left waiting in limbo without so much as simple acknowledgement from the province.


“There were no reasons given for denying my application, so I waited to hear something about my appeal,” says Regis.


After learning neighbours were receiving exemptions, Regis e-mailed the government once again and asked for clarification and if another application needed to be made or the appeal would suffice.


“I received a response directing me to the same websites I had already reviewed, which did not answer my question. So I applied again. And then I learned they wanted evidence I owned property in NL. So I sent a copy of my 2020 property tax bill. I received a response yesterday (Thursday, Aug. 27) directing me again to the websites I had already read.” 


Copies of the e-mails between the government and Regis and shared with the Wreckhouse Weekly confirm these exchanges and Regis’s growing frustration with the process. Finally on Friday, Aug. 28 Regis received approval for the travel exemption.


“I felt like I’d won the lottery. Only a lottery would have been less stressful because you know from the beginning that the odds aren’t that great,” says Regis. “It was frustrating to know that some had been allowed in and others denied with no rhyme or reason given. And again, I realize the need for caution. It’s a pandemic. There is a genuine health concern. But I live in a rural area of Ontario – far from any of the hotspots – and I live alone. I have pretty much self-isolated since mid-March, only going out bi-weekly for groceries. And I wore a mask long before it was mandated. I explained all of this in my initial application.”


Inquiries by the Wreckhouse Weekly also failed to solicit any clear explanation as to the logic behind acceptance or denial of applications by out-of-province homeowners in identical situations who applied for travel exemptions. However, it does seem apparent that timing played a factor in Regis receiving an exemption once the province continued to ease restrictions.


“Effective (Monday, August 31), people living outside Atlantic Canada in another Canadian province or territory who own a second home, vacation home or cabin in Newfoundland and Labrador will be allowed to enter the province,” wrote Kathy Dicks-Peyton, Media Relations Manager for the Department of Health and Community Services. “Anyone denied entry to the province prior to the August 31, 2020 change in entry criteria received denials based on the established Public Health entry guidelines at that time.”


Although overjoyed to be returning to Newfoundland, Regis is still feeling confused as to the exact reasons behind the initial rejection.


“If the government had simply advised property owners what they’re doing... for instance, if they wanted to allow just a few of us in at a time, just let us know. If they were using a lottery system, just let us know. It may mean we wouldn’t get in – I am never lucky with lotteries – but at least we’d know there’s some method to their process.”

  subtitles: "The ban of single use plastic bags goes into effect on October 1",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Starting on Oct. 1 consumers will have to remember to bring their own bags to stores if they haven’t started already. That’s when the provincial ban on the distribution of retail plastic bags will come into effect. People who choose to bring their own re-usable bags are advised to wash them frequently.


A press release by the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Municipalities on Sept. 2 outlined details of the upcoming ban and shared a remark by Minister Derek Bennett.


“Protecting the environment for future generations is a priority for our government. Banning the distribution and use of retail plastic bags protects the environment and improves the waste management system in our province. It is encouraging to see many communities, businesses and residents being proactive and switching to reusable shopping bags. I look forward to this ban being implemented and us all doing our part to reduce plastic waste.”


The move to ban the bags began in April of last year and builds on the province’s ongoing work with the Council on the Zero Plastic Waste Strategy as part of the Ocean Plastics Charter. 


At the 2015 and 2017 Annual General Meetings, Municipalities Newfoundland and Labrador (MNL) members voted in favour of a provincial ban on single-use plastic bags. In 2019, the ban became official with an expected implementation on July 1, but because of COVID-19 the date was pushed back. Newfoundland and Labrador will be the second province to implement this ban. Prince Edward Island became the first province to institute a ban earlier this year. 


When they don’t end up in landfills, single use plastic bags have a tendency to get blown around by the wind, often ending up alongside trails or polluting oceans, which can harm or even kill sea life. This also renders provincial parks and private lands unattractive. 

In its own release, MNL expressed strong support for the ban.


“This is a win for the residents of Newfoundland and Labrador. MNL advocated on this issue for years, and we are beyond thrilled to see our efforts come to fruition,” said President Sheila Fitzgerald.

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Although the Southwest Coast region has thus far come through the pandemic relatively unscathed, dealing with COVID-19 continues to prove troublesome for some residents, businesses and public facilities.


Even the Canadian Coast Guard is experiencing delays.


The current facility on Army Hill, which was built in 1977, has a pleasant view overlooking the harbour but is consistently exposed to severe weather, which can make it difficult for employees to access during wind and snowstorms. Bearing that in mind, the Coast Guard chose to build its new facility in Grand Bay West Industrial Park.


“Sustainability was a key consideration in the design and construction of this new infrastructure, including LED lighting and a high-performance building envelope designed to resist extreme weather conditions in the area, and help reduce energy costs. The use of natural light in the new building promotes employee health and well-being,” stated Janet Kelly via e-mail.


Kelly is the Communications Advisor for Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard.

Although the new Canadian Coast Guard Marine Communications and Traffic Services (MCTS) Centre may look complete, the 17 Coast Guard employees have yet to be relocated to the new building. 


“It is unknown when the move will be completed since preparatory work has been delayed by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and is ongoing,” wrote Kelly.


The scenery outside the window will eventually change for employees, but modern technology allows the Coast Guard to operate just as efficiently in the industrial park without a direct view of Port aux Basques harbour. 


“While much of our contact with marine traffic takes place with vessels in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and along the south coast, closed circuit video cameras are being installed on the tower on Army Hill to provide visual situational awareness of activity in the harbour,” noted Kelly.


A smaller structure will be constructed at the Army Hill site to house electronic equipment presently in use, but so far no decision has been made regarding the potential divestiture or disposal of the old building.

  subtitles: "Rosalyn Roy is the reporter for Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "Look I get it. I really do.


Time is precious and everybody’s always in a hurry. There are medical appointments, work schedules, family needs, errands to run and an endless list of demands on our time every single day.


I’m a reporter with inflexible deadlines, a driver’s license and a dog whose favourite word is ‘walk’. Whatever its flaws, Port aux Basques is usually a great town for walking, and if I can walk to an interview or to a destination I’ll usually choose to do it, depending on the weather.


But the crosswalks drive me absolutely crazy.


I’ve waited on the corner and watched four or five cars roll through before the sixth one will stop to let me cross. They’re not all speeding either, just making a choice to not less me cross while they roll on through without a moment’s hesitation.


I’ve watched parents with children in strollers or toddlers clinging to their fingers await an opening, elderly citizens with walkers or canes try to hurry across before the motorist speeds up, and other dog walkers try to restrain a beloved pet who is smart enough to recognize the purpose of a crosswalk while the motorists apparently don’t.


If you think I’m being harsh on motorists, you’re absolutely right.


In this province, statistically speaking there is nearly one fatality every single day. Transport Canada data reveals that pedestrians make up about 15 percent of all fatalities from vehicle collisions and still another 15 percent sustain serious injuries. That means Newfoundland and Labrador has the fourth highest rate of fatalities and the second highest rate of injuries, both of which are well above the national average.


That’s just not acceptable, and coupled with school about to resume and recent RCMP speeding reports that cited excessive speeds at multiple areas in town, it’s outright terrifying.


Not stopping for pedestrians waiting to cross at a designated is actually not optional either. Those four or five cars rolling through while I wait can be penalized heavily for failing to stop.


Under Section 125 (I) of the Highway Traffic Act, failing to yield right-of-way to a pedestrian in a crosswalk can result in fines of $115 and 2 demerit points off a driving license.

Pedestrians crossing outside of a designated crosswalk must yield right of way to approaching vehicles, but that also does not absolve a driver from using due care to avoid a collision.


So the next time you see someone waiting at a crosswalk please stop. Whatever momentary delay that inconveniences you pales in comparison to the one you’ll experience if you hit a pedestrian with your vehicle.

  subtitles: "Maxine Edwards (President) and Phyllis Horwood (Secretary) are members of RB Lighthouse Inc. volunteer board which runs the historic lighthouse. - Submitted",
  body: "SOUTHWEST COAST – It’s been 20 years and a lot of hard work from its volunteer board, but the historic lighthouse attraction in Rose Blanche is making significant strides towards becoming self-sustaining, or at least it seemed that way until COVID-19 threw an unexpected curveball into this summer’s plans.


The extra sanitization costs involved would have meant increased expenses just for cleaning, and with no visitors allowed into the province prior to the Atlantic bubble, the RB Lighthouse board felt it made more financial sense to keep the facility closed.


“If I had a business of my own, yes, I could try it, maybe make half of what I made last year and I got something out of it,” says Phyllis Horwood, who is the Secretary of RB Lighthouse Inc. “But the long-term goal was the viability of the whole site.”


About 80 percent of the lighthouse’s revenue comes from tourists outside the province, especially Québec and Ontario. Even with a push from the provincial government’s Staycation NL promotion, that drastic decrease in visitors would have set those plans for self-sustainability back even further. Although the lighthouse will continue to receive its operational grant of $8,000 from the provincial government, tourists remain its primary source of funding.


“We’ve got bills all year long. Like we’ve got over $5,000 in light bills every year,” notes Horwood. “The visitation was the biggest factor because that is where our revenue comes from – visitation – and we knew that would be down big time.”


Horwood says that The Lightkeepers Inn B&B was also growing in popularity after it was registered on Airbnb. Prior to the pandemic, it seemed reasonable to expect that it would continue to increase in popularity. After the provincial borders were closed to non-residents and prior to the Atlantic bubble, opening the accommodation would have meant operating at a loss. 


“We would have been able to rent only one room at a time because of social distancing,” says Horwood. ““If previous years were any indication, Newfoundland alone wasn’t going to do it for us.”


Also factoring into the decision was the cost of hiring employees. There are government programs to help offset some of the staffing expenses but it would have still been insufficient to cover the cost.


Moreover, since the lighthouse is a non-profit organization, summer tourist revenues also help to offset startup costs for the following season, which meant that choosing to open this year even for provincial tourism would reverberate into next season.


The lighthouse saw an estimated 5,300 visitors last year, some from as far away as Europe. That number has remained consistent, or increased slightly, over the past few years.


“We did so well with our B&B, we thought this year we’re going to pay off our loan, because we’ve got a loan for the B&B,” adds Maxine Edwards, President of RB Lighthouse Inc. “This summer was going to bring us out right on top and we’d be moving forward and finally become almost, but not quite, self-sustainable.”


“We didn’t want to go in debt at a point to where you’re not going to recover,” says Edwards.


“It’s so hard to build it up but it is happening,” promises Horwood.


In an effort to keep the site open for locals to enjoy the scenery and take a walk, the main gate was left open and signage was posted advising guests they were welcome to walk the trails, albeit at their own risk.


Plans for future upgrades after the tourists return and the loan is paid off are still in their infancy, but one idea is a Newfoundland twist on camping known as glamping, or glamorous camping. This is camping with extra amenities or services as opposed to traditional tent camping.


“How nice they would be out there by the ocean?” asks Horwood rhetorically.


About an hour’s drive up the coast, the Cape Ray Lighthouse Museum and Crafts also chose not to open this summer. Like the Rose Blanche lighthouse, Cape Ray depends heavily on tourists and the income generated by its craft shops.


Other than grants to help employ workers, Cape Ray doesn’t receive any government funding.


Anne Osmond, Chairperson of the Cape Ray Lightkeepers Museum Committee says that the museum simply wasn’t prepared to open after the pandemic forced its initial closure.


“When we open we have the craft store all ready, and people weren’t prepared to bring in their crafts,” explains Osmond. “And we do very well from on the craft store from local crafts.”


In order to help offset existing expenses like insurance, the non-profit museum will try drumming up some contributions by appealing to the region’s residents. They’ve already held one, a grocery bingo that Osmond says raised about $700. Details surrounding future fundraisers are still being worked out.

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The town’s increasing rat problem can make living close to an unkempt property more worrisome than just lowering property values.


Like most municipalities, Port aux Basques has drafted regulations and by-laws in order to regulate and even enforce developments and properties so that they don’t become eyesores or attract pests.


The relevant acts, available for viewing via the town’s website, are the Occupancy and Maintenance Regulations and the Garbage Regulations. These bylaws enforce compliance and outline rules when it comes to property conditions and rules for town homeowners.


One of the problems facing Port aux Basques when it comes to tackling the increasing number of rats is that seaside communities and natural harbours historically tend to attract them. And while the town does call in a pest control company for help, Town Manager Leon MacIsaac states that Port aux Basques has neither the equipment nor the trained personnel to deal with the rodents.


“It is the responsibility of every resident to ensure that properties are kept clean of debris and animal feces, mow tall grasses that provide hiding places, garbage is not left unattended, collection bins are kept clean so that issues are kept to a minimum,” wrote MacIsaac via e-mail. “While the Town does address rodent issues on all public property, it is the residents’ responsibility to address private rodent issues.” 


MacIsaac admits that the town regularly receives complaints from property owners whose neighbours have unsightly property, and those complaints are investigated to determine what, if any, follow up action is required.


The town may choose to issue an Order for Compliance, and a property owner receiving a compliance order will have a set time in order to ensure they meet the standards required. If the property owner does not meet conditions in time, the town may also choose to rectify any issues entirely at the owner’s expense.


But just reaching that point can be a lengthy process, which may leave adjacent property owners feeling frustrated.


“A property owner has a right to appeal the Order to the regional Appeal Board. This process can be time consuming with frequent delays. If an appeal is filed the Town cannot enforce the Order until the appeal board makes a decision,” wrote MacIsaac.

Alternatively, the town may circumvent the process by reaching agreements with property owners instead.


“The Town acquired the Lukey’s Boat property through an agreement with the former owner. The building, due to age, structural and electrical issues, was in a state of disrepair that would take considerable funding to make repairs and bring to appropriate standards,” explained MacIsaac.


Once the town acquired the property, the decision was made to remove the structure and incorporate the land itself as additional space for the the Scott’s Cove area as part of the Downtown Revitalization Development Plan. 


MacIsaac says the plan for the space has yet to be finalized but the hope is to provide extra parking, landscaping and open space amenities for town residents.

  subtitles: "The Rennie family bible was published in 1892, and will remain on display at the Cape Ray Lighthouse Museum and Crafts. - submitted",
  body: "CAPE RAY – After years of work and at the request of the family, the Rennie bible has made its way from The Rooms in St. John’s to its new permanent home at the Cape Ray Lighthouse Museum and Crafts.


In 1871, Robert Rennie was the first keeper stationed at the original wooden lighthouse, a job that earned him $600 per year. Last summer his great-granddaughter, Caroline Taylor, visited the museum and decided that the family bible belonged nearer to his legacy.


“She said the bible is in The Rooms in St. John’s, and she said that ‘We’d like to have it in its proper place, where he lived’,” recalls Anne Osmond, who is the Chairperson for the Cape Ray Lighthouse Keepers Committee.


The massive bible could easily be mistaken for a work of art. It measures about a foot tall and roughly five inches thick, with a striking red and gold embossed cover. Printed in 1892, almost every page is filled with black and white or full colour engravings depicting biblical scenes or maps. There are 2000 illustrations in total. One side of the cover has crumbled, and Osmond uses white cloth gloves and a delicate touch when she turns a page.


Because the museum remained closed this summer due to COVID-19, the bible hasn’t yet received many visitors outside of the staff. Now that the winter months are approaching, the Rennie bible will be placed carefully into storage for the winter to protect it from possible damage from damp or cold.


“We got it at the end of last year but we didn’t bring it out. It was in storage,” says Osmond. “So this summer we bought it out just to see what we’re going to do with it, how to display it. We had to put it in a proper case.”


Along with the bible, the museum’s exhibit contains time worn photographs of the Rennie family and various hand-written documents. There are other photos nearby too, including ones of the lighthouse before and after it was charred by a fire, and details about the keepers who worked the lighthouse after Robert’s tenure.


The last keeper, Gordon Thomas, left in 1991 when the Cape Ray lighthouse became fully automated.


The Cape Ray museum displays its treasures in what was once his home, and the small building next to the tower was declared a Recognized Federal Heritage Building in 2007.

  subtitles: "Feeding foxes at the Cape Ray lighthouse could harm their chances at survival.",
  body: "CAPE RAY – Staff at the Cape Ray Lighthouse Museum and Crafts say a family of about nine foxes are living nearby and attracting attention. Residents from around the region are captivated by the furry family, and some have been visiting the area almost daily hoping to catch a glimpse and perhaps snap a candid photo or two.


The foxes don’t seem to mind, even having been captured on video and in photographs doing some people watching of their own.


But the foxes may be getting too close for everyone’s comfort or safety – especially their own.


“I’ll tell you how close he was. Cathy (Musseau) was sitting there painting and he got his nose full of paint,” offers Renee Ford, who is currently working at the museum.


This is the first summer the large fox family has been in such close proximity, although a pair was first spotted wandering the area in Feburary or March after a successful hunt.


“He came back with a seagull in his mouth or a fish,” notes Yvonne MacDougall.


As they become more accustomed to humans it can prove problematic for both species. Those problems become exacerbated rather quickly if people feed the foxes.


Craig Renouf, Media Relations Manager for Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture says that people shouldn’t get too close to the foxes or their den, and above all, they should resist the temptation to feed them.


“While there are no specific Provincial Government regulations that prohibit people from feeding wildlife, the practice is strongly discouraged as predatory species such as fox, lynx, coyotes, wolves or black bears can be very dangerous to humans or pets or transmit diseases if a bite occurs,” wrote Renouf via e-mail. “Animals such as these can become habituated or accustomed to humans if a source of food or garbage is readily available. When wild animals become habituated, their natural fear of humans decreases and they take more chances to access food. Habituated animals are unpredictable and may become aggressive.”


When that happens, the consequences for the foxes may eventually prove deadly.


“While conservation officers endeavor to relocate wild animals when possible by trapping and relocating, habituated animals that pose a threat to human safety may have to be euthanized through no fault of their own,” said Renouf.


Tips for dealing with wildlife


The Department of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture recommends that if wild animals are near your home, cabin or campsite, that you:


• Do not approach wild animals to touch, feed or photograph them.

• Do not feed wild animals, even if you think an animal looks hungry.

• Do not leave food, pet food, bottles, pop cans or food containers outdoors.

• Store food, garbage, coolers, camp stoves, pots and pans in your shed, cabin or vehicle.

• Harvest fruit from fruit trees when ripe.

• Keep dairy products and meat out of compost piles.

• Clean barbecue grills after use to minimize odour.

• Remove bird feeders from your yard in April and replace them in November.

• Store garbage inside a shed or garage until just before pick-up.

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The Lion’s Club Friday Night Dart League is slated to return to play on Sept. 18 at 8 p.m. after months of hiatus due to the pandemic.


“In March when the COVID came we gave up,” says League President Jay Strickland. “We usually go until the middle of May.”


Strickland has been playing for 14 years, taking up the sport after he moved back to the area from Kitchener, Ontario. This will be his second year serving as League President, and although the virus is still around, the league has protocols in place to prevent possible spread.


In addition to regular sanitizing, tables will be placed far enough apart that team bubbles can remain intact. Isolated within their bubble and when shooting won’t require a mask, but leaving their area to go to the bar or washroom means players will have to wear one. A mask will also be required whenever a player is entering or exiting the building.


Despite the new restrictions, players are still signing on. In fact, the league has seen a slight uptick in the number of teams that have registered.


“Last year we only had four, as we were new at getting the league up on the go,” says Strickland. “So far this year we have five full teams.”


Strickland says there’s still plenty of room for more, and experience is not required. Players can form their own team prior to registering, or can be assigned to a team.


“I enjoy getting out for a fun night with the guys,” offers Strickland.


Sunday nights are reserved for a mixed league and there is also a woman’s league scheduled for Thursday. Whether or not dart tournaments will be held this year remains undetermined.

This month I would like to share a recipe for a flourless chocolate torte. Yes, you read that right. I bet I know what you’re thinking; a cake without flour? But how?


Well you’re about to find out! I’m going to show you how you can make your own flourless chocolate torte (Torta al Cioccolato Senza Farina).


Instructions:

Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Wrap an 8-inch spring form pan tightly with 2 pieces of aluminum foil.


In a dish big enough to hold the pan, pour ½ cup of water in the bottom. Lay it in the oven to start warming.


Over a double boiler, melt chocolate chips and butter. Stir until melted. Once chocolate mixture is melted remove from heat and cool.


Mix eggs until doubled and pale yellow, then add sugar and vanilla. Fold egg mixture into the chocolate mixture. When combined, pour the mixture into your springform pan.


Carefully put the springform pan inside the water bath pan and bake for 30 minutes. 


Remove from oven and place on cooling rack. Once it’s cool, refrigerate overnight until fully set.


Once it’s ready, cut off a slice and enjoy it with fresh fruit, chocolate ganache, or whatever else strikes your fancy!",

  subtitles: "Port aux Basques council has been holding meetings in the fire hall to comply with social distancing recommendations. - © J. René Roy",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Another resident of Kyle Lane asked Town Council to prohibit overnight camping at the most recent Town Council meeting, which was held on the evening of Sept. 8 at the fire hall. Deputy Mayor Todd Strickland and Coun. Melvin Keeping were the only two councillors not in attendance.


Overnight camping continues

Hiram Billard spoke again on behalf of residents of Kyle Lane and Grand Bay West who are worried about possible damage to the wetlands, the impact on native bird species like the endangered piping plover, and unpleasant encounters with tourists choosing to camp on the parking lot. Billard presented a petition signed by 9 of 10 homeowners on the street requesting the ban.


“Free parking don’t make sense to me when the residents have to pay taxes to live here,” said Billard at one point. “If you do want to put free camping somewhere, we suggest Hopedale Avenue.”


Coun. Jim Lane clarified that he’s not in favour of making the beach parking lot a free campground, but doesn’t agree that campers coming late off the boat should be prohibited from stopping there overnight before continuing on.


“My argument for it, in support of parking there – it was a band-aid effect until that fellow could get his (private campground) park up and running,” said Lane. “I do not disagree with your concerns.”


Mayor John Spencer liked the Hopedale Avenue idea and even noted that a large commercial site there had just become available, but Town Clerk Julia Ingram stated that this property had actually already been sold. The mayor also ordered another attendee to comply with the order to remove the private signs he had erected, even though they have been covered up.


Later during a review of the notes from the Aug. 18 council meeting where Lynn Jamieson made a similar presentation, Coun. Chester Coffin put forward a motion that council erect its own signage prohibiting overnight parking.


The motion failed to find a seconder and therefore did not move forward to a vote. Mayor Spencer noted that two councillors were absent and asked Coun. Coffin to put the motion to the floor again at the next meeting of council.


Matthews Lane

Town Manager Leon MacIsaac clarified that after examining documents provided to council, the town does not own what is actually a private right-of-way. He estimated that the town would have to conduct a total of seven surveys, title searches, and may incur other expenses in order to legally claim ownership of the road in order to pave and plow it. Currently the town only plows it on occasion and considers it a side road.


“I’m lost with that, Town Manager, because we’ve taken over roads before and we never went through none of that,” said Coun. Lane.


MacIsaac replied that this was the legal advice he had received. Lane made a motion to go ahead and pave the road, but Spencer asked him to wait until the next meeting of council to put forth the motion, when the other two councillors would return.

Since Coun. Justin Blackler had missed the last meeting when the matter was discussed in more detail, he also requested that the motion be delayed.


“Even if I could be able to talk to you after and you fill me in more,” suggested Blackler. “I’d feel better about it.”


Rat pack

After delivering the Public Works report, Coun. Lane asked for a bit more time to come up with a solution to the town’s growing rat infestation. Lane noted a number of contributing factors to the problem, including storm surges and construction that may be disturbing nests. The biggest factor remains the wooden garbage boxes, which either have gaps in the slats or the rats can chew through to reach bags that are left out for days, sometimes up to a full week, before the next collection.


“It’s providing a constant food source,” said Lane.


The committee is still rolling through all possible solutions and wants more time to figure out the best one before offering its final recommendation to council.


“We’re looking at the easiest financial positioning for residents,” noted Lane.


The mayor agreed to the extension, but recounted more stories of residents battling the vermin and stated that boxes cleaned out this morning will be filled up again by evening.


“We may have to take a very serious look at that,” said Spencer. “It’s an issue that we’ve created. We’ve got to try to fix it.”


Letters to Council

A new town resident wrote a letter expressing concern about the cars racing up and down Brook Hill. The resident has a child with autism, is worried about their safety and requested signage asking drivers to slow down. Council has agreed to post a sign.


The fire department is unable to secure additional bunker gear for its three new firefighters. The provincial fire department has rejected the Channel-Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department’s request, stating that this year’s budget has been spent and advising the department to reapply early in the new year. The cost of outfitting a new firefighter with their own bunker gear is roughly $1,000.


A resident who lost her son in 2011 wrote a letter to council asking that the town rename the Grand Bay West Trailway after her son, who helped build the trail originally. The resident had initially installed a bench along the popular hiking trail in memory of her son, but after it was vandalized repeatedly she removed it altogether. Council voted unanimously to honour the request.


Mayor Spencer shared a letter from Elvis Loveless, Minister of Fishery, Forestry and Agriculture about the live and cold storage feasibility study planned for the former fish plant. Economic Development Officer Shauna Strickland shared that she will be informed about the timeline as the project progresses.


“Hopefully that will come with some positive things for our community,” said Spencer.

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The Bruce II Sports Centre is still adapting to the new rules for operating as a public building in the era of COVID-19.


All of the facility’s employees were adversely affected when the province first enacted safety regulations to cope with the pandemic, says manager Wanda Merrigan.


“Most were laid off and some had reduced hours. We have six seasonal staff who are laid off every year but left earlier than anticipated. Including lifeguards, approximately 19 people were affected,” wrote Merrigan via e-mail. “Fourteen have returned and hopefully the rest will follow in the next few weeks.”


The pool and gym facilities have reopened with new restrictions in place, but the hours of use have decreased to allow for cleaning. In order to comply with physical distancing recommendations, the number of users has also been decreased.


“Swim lessons haven’t started yet. At this point our instructors are not allowed in the water to teach classes, so we are working on a plan for lessons,” shared Merrigan.


Local sporting groups, like Port aux Basques Minor Hockey and the Port aux Basques Figure Skating Club use the facility regularly, and Merrigan says that the facility is working closely to implement and develop plans for safe return to play.


“We are hoping to have the ice on in early October,” wrote Merrigan.


The future of the canteen service remains uncertain, and Merrigan speculates that it may be able to open only for take out. Currently no food consumption is allowed in the sports centre’s lobby area.


“I’ve had many questions from parents regarding reopening and I don’t have a lot of answers,” admitted Merrigan. “COVID-19 regulations are a work in progress and we are doing our very best to follow the government guidelines to ensure our users stay healthy.”

Shauna Strickland presented the Recreation Committee Report at the Sept. 8 council meeting, which discussed many of the new safety precautions.


The maximum number of users will be capped at 60, and skaters will not be able to use the dressing room. Children under 9 will be able to have a parent or guardian accompany them, but older users will not. Strickland also outlined some unknowns remaining when it comes to bowling, as the committee is awaiting information from the user groups. Meanwhile the swim team will focus only on its competitive swimmers.


Coun. Jim Lane objected to the Recreation Committee’s proposed reopening date and asked for a review of the Sports Centre’s financial status first, given the heavy losses due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Mayor John Spencer agreed that it only made sense to examine the projected costs and revenues for the winter season, which Council will undertake before settling on a definitive date for reopening the Bruce II.

  subtitles: "Karen Simon has been experiencing service issues since Western Petroleum removed its local office - submitted",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Western Petroleum’s decision to close its Port aux Basques office in August 2019 remains both inconvenient and controversial.


Customers who used to debit at the office when purchasing home heating oil as needed are now obliged to pay online through the bank, then told to call the Corner Brook office again three days later to determine whether or the payment has been credited to their account. Only then can they arrange to receive their furnace oil delivery. 


The alternative, to arrange for a monthly credit card charge or automatic bank account withdrawal, is not always convenient or even necessary, especially for seniors who don’t bank online or are on a fixed income and must budget their monthly expenditures carefully.

Aside from this inconvenience, it seems that obtaining service or repairs under the parts protecting plan is also causing some frustration. When Irvings withdrew from the region in 2006, Western Petroleum assumed its customers parts protection plan. One of those customers is Karen Simon.


“I purchased my furnace through Irvings,” explains Simon via e-mail. “Irvings covered the protection plan until 2006 and Western Petroleum took over then.”


Simons says she has been paying yearly for the parts protection plan, which got cancelled this year after a service technician came out on a call.


“I received a letter stating that my parts protection plan was now cancelled because of the flex piping, which Irvings installed,” wrote Simon. “I wonder why they would honour the parts protection plan for 14 years and now when parts are becoming harder to get they cancel the coverage? I do know my parents had one installed the same time, and their protection plan is still valid.”


But even with a valid protection plan, just getting a technician to come all the way out to the Southwest Coast is not necessarily guaranteed. When her parents had a problem with their furnace, the head office declined to send out a technician unless it was first determined to be a parts problem causing the issue.


“Mom was actually told to bleed the line first. They went on to explain that it was only a screw that had to be loosened. My Mom is 80,” says Simon. “I don’t know about you but I wouldn’t have any idea how to bleed the line.”


After making some calls, Simon reached a local company who paid a visit of their own and ascertained that it was a parts problem, so that Simon could get Western Petroleum to send out the technician.


Also factoring into the equation are scheduling and weather.


“If the technician is on vacation there is no coverage,” continues Simon. “In the winter, if the winds are above 70 kph (at the Wreckhouse) the technician will not travel over the road. So when a technician is needed the most there may not be one to get.”


David J. Brown, the Operations & Sales Manager for Western Petroleum in Corner Brook says he is unable to comment on any individual service issues.


“We respond to no-heat calls within a 24-hour period. Inclement weather becomes a safety issue for our employees and contractors, therefore this may at times cause delays which would be no different for any other service related industry,” replied Brown to e-mail inquiries.


Brown promises the company is working on finding a more timely solution for service calls.

“We have struggled to find a reliable service technician for Port aux Basques area. We have looked after emergency service calls for our customers there as required from Corner Brook in the interim, and we hope to have a new service technician in place by mid-month for the upcoming heating season,” wrote Brown. “We will continue to service our parts protection plans form Corner Brook until we have someone in place to provide the service for us closer to the Port aux Basques area.” 


Meanwhile Karen Simon has little alternative but to find a competitor for her service calls. No doubt a local Western Petroleum technician would remain much more convenient for her parents and others still protected by the original service plan.


“For them not to be available to this section of the province is unacceptable,” maintains Simon.

 If there were to be a Mount Rushmore of local hockey figures, he would undoubtedly be one of the prominent figures in this sculpture. He was literally there at the beginning of minor hockey in this town.


Beginning in 1967, and over the years, Jim was involved in multiple divisions of minor hockey and introduced countless children to the game. Over the 80’s and 90’s, he presided over the beginning of junior hockey and made his mark as a leader in local senior hockey as well.


There probably isn’t a task that he did not perform to ensure that his teams got a game of hockey.


Since his passing, social media has been filled with countless tributes and messages from the many players who sat on his bench, and in his whose lives he played a positive role.

There are many out there who shared a closer bond or played countless more games and practices with Jim than me. I won’t try to share their stories, as I would not be able to do justice to them.


I can tell about my first experience with the man with the gravelly voice and the heart of gold.


 I was a young first year bantam goaltender about to take the pads off after a regular practice when Jim came in through the door and said with a voice that both excited me and scared the life out of me, “Parsons, we needs a second goalie for practice”.


To say that there was only one answer would be to confirm the obvious. And when he put his powerful hand on my shoulder, it only further cemented what that answer was.  

Jim was deeply humbled to have been admitted into the provincial Hockey Hall of Fame in 2012.

It was a recognition of his efforts and his impact and one that he did not seek, but most certainly deserved. 


When I chatted with him about it that summer, he told me all about the event and the fact that he was honoured to be inducted in the same class as former Premier Danny Williams. I was quick to remind Jim that it was the former Premier who should be honoured to be in the same class as him.  


I would be remiss if I did not mention that recognizing Jim without his beloved Lucy would be impossible.


They were truly a team in all of his endeavours, and she played a motherly figure to his players. She also took it upon herself to ensure that the uniforms were patched and ready, and that the bingo cards were done. Her role cannot go unnoticed or without recognition.


The passing of a loved one is usually a dark moment in time. Undoubtedly the loss of someone of Jim’s stature is one that is felt for what feels like eons.


But I say that we should take solace in celebrating the mark that he made, and the joy and opportunity he brought to so many over decades of volunteerism.


What we should feel is love for a person who gave so much to so many, and left behind good memories and great stories that will be told for many years to come. 


The coach is being called up to the big leagues, and more importantly, to join his beloved Lucy, his partner through it all.


Rest In Peace Mr. Hayward.

  subtitles: "Children returned to school on Wednesday, Sept. 9, but not everyone got a seat on the school bus.",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District (NLESD) has admitted that its new busing policy, which allows no more than 46 students on a school bus, has reduced provincial capacity by over 6,000 students.


Heather May, Director of Strategic Planning, Policy and Communications stated via e-mail that this has put the NLESD in a very difficult position.


“With just weeks to school opening, as there were not enough available school buses to make up this disparity for the beginning of the school year,” wrote May.


Also finding themselves in a difficult position are parents like Joanie Sheppard. Her 10-year-old son, Christopher, was facing a long walk across Hardy’s Arterial, which does not have a sidewalk, after the school called to confirm he would not get a seat on the bus.

For the single mother, the inconvenience came coupled with a huge safety concern. 


Sheppard and Christopher have walked the road together a few times, but since he is autistic she says she has to keep reminding him to stay on the side.


“I don’t have a vehicle and I didn’t have any way to get him back and forth,” says Sheppard. “I started reaching out to people and it didn’t seem like I was getting anywhere.”


On the last Friday before the start of school, she was able to find a ride for Christopher thanks to a helpful neighbour.


“I don’t understand their process really,” admits Sheppard. “I just got a call that said he was ineligible.”


Sheppard says she also doesn’t understand the rules around masks. Children are obliged to wear them on buses but can take them off in classrooms, even if the seats are closer than the two metre recommendation. She says she is feeling a bit frustrated and has found the situation somewhat stressful.


She’s not alone. Social media has been flooded with posts by frustrated parents around the region and across the entire province.


“The District set about reorganizing province-wide student transportation services to accommodate the first 46 eligible students assigned to the current school bus runs, based on the morning bus stop order,” wrote May.


That answer does little to clarify instances such as why a bus stop located over 5 km away from St. James Elementary School and geographically located at the end of a route was somehow designated as a third stop, and forced very young children off the bus while children living closer to school got a seat. Meanwhile families with several children were told some could ride the bus, while others could not.


May says that the NLESD is working to resolve the issue.


“On Thursday, September 3, the Provincial Government announced it would allocate additional funding to ensure all normally eligible students will receive student transportation services by the end of September,” wrote May.


Given that many of the buses must be sourced, purchased and inspected from outside the province, that timeline may be more hopeful than practical. It also remains unclear how many new buses will be sent to this region.


“The District will assign these new resources as soon as possible,” promised May. “In the meantime, unfortunately, some parents must make their own arrangements to get their children to school by whatever means they deem safe.”


Although she’s arranged to get him to school in the meantime, Sheppard is among the many parents hoping for a new bus soon to cover her son’s route.

“I would say I’ll put him on the bus. He really enjoys that.”",

  subtitles: "Seconds can make a difference when emergency services is having trouble finding an address.",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES - Having a number on your home comes with multiple advantages. A civic number is critical to identifying an address not only for everyday deliveries, but is primarily essential for emergency services. 


According to town manager Leon MacIsaac, “Residents fail to realize the importance of having a civic number properly displayed so that emergency personnel can locate your home in the event of a fire or a medical issue. The loss of a home or life can easily be prevented if the property can be quickly located and should not require the assistance of the municipality.”


Fire Chief Jerry Musseau agrees. 


“Civic addressing is essential for a more efficient response by emergency services as a way to quickly and easily identify the location where to respond. Although we live in a small town it could still be frustrating if we can’t find a house, and in an emergency seconds count. We have responded in the past and not known exactly where to go because of no civic number, even though we were in the general area.”


To install a number on a house is relatively simple and inexpensive. They are available at many stores in town for only a few dollars.


It's not only the fire department that can lose precious seconds of response time. Ambulance services and police response can also be improved by having a number on a home.


As these emergency services are frequently staffed by people from outside the area, making that number visible from the road is also important. Seconds lost in the search for a particular building not easily identified can mean the difference between life and death.

The display of civic numbers is not mandated within town limits, although Town Council does send out reminders every year with tax statements. 


Chief Musseau concludes, “I would like to see all homes with a number displayed, and if possible be visible from the street. It is for the homeowners benefit to have a civic address displayed as you need emergency personnel to be able to respond quickly if you requested them.”",

  subtitles: "Marine Atlantic’Cost recovery rates remain a hot button issue for Port aux Basques council. - © J. René Roy",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Mayor John Spencer surrendered his chair in order to deliver a passionate speech about the federally mandated Marine Atlantic cost recovery during the last meeting of council on Tuesday evening, Sept. 8. Spencer has been arguing against the 65 percent cost recovery rate since taking office and is an ardent, vocal opponent of the practice, which he considers a financial burden for the resident taxpayers of Newfoundland and Labrador.


In his opening remarks, Spencer took aim at Municipalities Newfoundland and Labrador (MNL) for classifying the issue as a Category C.



“It simply means they’ll observe, for want of a better word. They won’t be involved in any advocacy effort and I feel that was an injustice,” said Spencer, who wants to go back to MNL and push for stronger support. “Being a Category C, it will die this November at convention and I feel that MNL has not taken up this cause at all.”


The Mayor shared that he seized the opportunity to move the issue higher on a provincial scale by speaking directly to Premier Andrew Furey during his recent visit to town. He stated that he is constantly writing letters to MPs (Members of Parliament), and received a reply from Gudie Hutchings (Long Range Mountains).


Hutchings stated in her letter that she meets regularly with Marine Atlantic’s board, and that among her most pressing concerns is safe and affordable passage. The MP pledged to continue to raise the topic with Marc Garneau, Minister of Transport, at every opportunity.

“My colleagues at Transport Canada are also very aware of the concerns around cost recovery,” wrote Hutchings.


After speaking with Furey, Spencer followed up via letter and shared the response from Bernard Davis, who was recently appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Service. Davis shared similar concerns, particularly about the province’s overall ability to recover from the negative financial impact of COVID-19 should the ferry service implement another rate hike. In his letter of support, Davis said he would arrange a meeting with Marine Atlantic in the near future to address the issue, something that failed to impress the mayor.


“I wrote him back this afternoon and said, ‘You’re starting at the wrong place, Minister’,” relayed Spencer. “Marine Atlantic Inc. can’t do a thing.”


The mayor reminded council that Marine Atlantic is ordered by Transport Canada to meet its annual cost recovery targets, which is currently 65 percent for the Gulf service, 100 percent for the Gulf on-service offerings such as meals, and 100 percent on the Argentia service.


Spencer did offer to partner with Davis to petition Garneau and the federal government to keep its 2015 election promise. Prior to his 2015 win, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau lambasted then Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s Tories about cost recovery and swore to address the issue once taking office. Instead the rate hikes have continued unabated and above the standard cost of living increases.


“Seeing that at the end of this letter really bothers me, because it tells me that they’re not aware of the issue,” said Spencer. “So where do we go? Should we go back to MNL and say we want this as a Category A?”


Coun. Justin Blackler questioned how MNL even decides how to categorize issues that are raised by its members. At a previous MNL conference, Port aux Basques’ presentation about the impact of cost recovery on the entire province received 99 percent support from the membership.


“What gets you from a C to an A? Is it just the way you present it or support you get from the membership?” asked Blackler. “If you got 99 percent support, what else do you need for an A rating?”


“The problem with it the first time around was that Municipalities didn’t even want to deal with it, didn’t want to put it on their list,” said Coun. Jim Lane. “We fought and got it on there.”


Spencer stated he would investigate the criteria for ranking issues and share any clarification with council. Meanwhile he wants to look at touring areas of the province to present the town’s cost recovery model in order to educate people and drum up support.

“I’m still shocked that people don’t get it,” said Spencer.


He noted that prior to the meeting he signed a cheque on behalf of the town that included an additional 280 dollar cost recovery charge.


“Every taxpayer in this town just paid that company, that went on that ferry, a subsidy,” stated Spencer. “It was a large trucking company.”


It’s standard practice for suppliers to pass extra shipping charges related to cost recovery onto their customers. Spencer said he took the liberty of forwarding a copy of that invoice to those he’s been e-mailing regularly about cost recovery to prove that point.


“They’re saying cost recovery doesn’t affect us? It affects every one of us,” said Spencer.

This year’s MNL conference is scheduled for Nov. 5 and will be held virtually.


Meanwhile Marine Atlantic’s Corporate Communications Officer Darrell Mercer stated via e-mail that it’s still too early to determine if there will be another rate hike this year.


“No final decisions have been made at this time. We complete our budgetary review and projections for the coming year during the fall months. We will be in a better position to provide an update following the completion of that process.”

  subtitles: "Cpl. Helm of the Port aux Basques RCMP says that there is now an active investigation into the recent rash of prank calls to the town’s fire department.. - © J. René Roy",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – There have been a rash of prank phone calls to the Channel-Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department in recent days. Over the span of Saturday evening, Sept. 12 through to Monday evening, Sept. 14, there have been a total of five prank calls. 

Fire Chief Jerry Musseau has called the trend discouraging. Via phone interview, Musseau shared the details of a pair of calls received on Sunday evening, Sept. 13. 


 “We received the call from a female voice saying, ‘There’s a fire on the government wharf! Please hurry!’ Again we responded and when we arrived there was no fire. There wasn’t anybody around to advise us.”


Musseau goes on to explain that there was no phone number left on the voicemail or on the caller I.D.


“I checked the answering machine at the fire hall and that showed an unknown number,” said Musseau. “The next call was received by someone who said they were in Newtown, and the way I understood, he said there was a fire in his backyard and he needed someone there. And he gave a phone number as well.”


That phone number turned out to be false, like the call. There was indeed a fire in the Newtown area, but it was a safe backyard fire pit, attended and under control. The residents of the location were somewhat surprised to have the fire department show up at their driveway.


Musseau is certainly frustrated by the recent trend.


“The more times this happens or gets repeated, eventually we will get a real call and we wont be able to respond as quickly as we need to,” said the fire chief. “People are not realizing the consequences of a prank phone call. Our resources and equipment are rolled out to a call and we don’t find anything, and at the same time there could be a real emergency in another part of town or a highway accident and we are gone on a prank call. Every second counts in an emergency and peoples lives can be put in danger by this. This is very serious stuff.”


Musseau is also worried that prolonged prank calls could eventually lead to a slower response time or fewer responders rolling out to a scene.


“Eventually it’s going to lead to firefighters... paying less attention to them and then we get a real alarm and that could have much more of an affect on the firefighters.”


Under the province’s Emergency 911 Act, false, frivolous or vexatious calls to 911 are an offence with possible financial penalties of up to $1,000 and/or imprisonment.


The calls have happened so frequently that the Port aux Basques detachment of the RCMP have opened an investigation.


“This is not a joke,” said Cpl. Helm. “These men and women are putting their lives on the line every phone call that comes in. They are attending to make sure that the community is safe. And somebody out there feels the need to make a joke of this, and this is not a joke. Furthermore, when we do find out who is involved, they will be charged criminally, and could be charged civilly.” 


Helm explained that when the fire department is dispatched to a frivolous call, if a serious emergency occurs elsewhere, civil liability could occur.


“In my 13 years of policing, I’ve never seen anything like this,” says Helm. “If you are involved in these prank calls you need to stop and you need to stop now. If you are aware of who is involved, then you need to come forward and let us know here at the RCMP, or even the fire department. Because this criminal investigation is taking place.”  


A recent post on the Port aux Basques Fire Department’s Facebook page is asking parents to talk to their children to explain the gravity of prank calling emergency services.

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Town Manager Leon MacIsaac has been in contact with Newfoundland Power about their work along the highway just before Edna’s Road to figure out just what they’re doing. At the Sept. 8 meeting of council, MacIsaac read aloud a letter he received from the company’s General Manager of Operations Jim Gilmour.


“Our commitment to mobile generation at the Grand Bay substation has not changed,” wrote Gilmour.


As part of the refurbishment, the corporation is putting down concrete pads for the mobile generator units, as well as installing new fuel tank lines, control lines and various associated systems. The units may be required elsewhere across the province, but will be scheduled to be returned to the Grand Bay substation.


Gilmour’s letter also reaffirmed the commitment to ensure the Dr. Charles L. LeGrow Health Centre retains power in the event of an outage, though that work has yet to be started. Meanwhile Mobile Generator 3, which is currently in use in the Twilingate area, should return to the Grand Bay substation towards the end of October.


Under questioning by Mayor John Spencer, MacIsaac stated that the cost of all this work was around 1.3 million dollars.


“The public utilities board has said that one of those generators has to stay here at all times. It’s a smaller one, but we’ve been fighting to keep the two here,” said Spencer. “One in Grand Bay, plus Rose Blanche, to look after our needs,” said Spencer.


Town Clerk Julia Ingram told Council that she has also received an assurance about the work on the Lions Club, which serves as a warming station in the event of a prolonged outage.


“It will definitely be in place before the winter season,” said Ingram.

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – It’s early September, and at first glance, Emily Hepditch looks more like a typical college student than a promising author of thriller novels. Her first book, The Woman in the Attic, has been published by Flanker Press and there’s already a second novel on the horizon.


In this new age of social distancing, Emily steps out of the blinding sunshine into a charming, if somewhat rough, fishing stage and smooths her skirt under her thin legs before taking a seat on a vintage armchair and leaning forward to chat.


“I write thrillers, mostly. That’s what I’ve written for most of my life but I hope to branch out eventually and write more contemporary, some historical fiction, but all with a mystery kind of edge to them,” she says. “I’ve been writing forever really. I know that’s kind of a cheesy answer but I’ve known I wanted to be a writer since I was in Grade 2 or 3.”


Her first book was a 100-page effort she wrote in Grade 7 with the help of a friend who transcribed everything she whispered. She kept writing through to university, originally intending to build a career in speech language pathology.


“I did linguistics and psychology and had a broad interest in that,” she recalls. “I did a diploma of criminology.”


Those areas of study also helped her writing. Upon graduation, she figured it was now or never to develop her passion for the pen into a career.


The result of that dedication was her debut novel, The Woman in the Attic, which centers around a young woman who returns home to her ailing mother’s saltbox house and uncovers a hidden attic with a gruesome secret.


Eventually Emily intends to go to grad school, but for now she wants to keep focusing full time on writing more books. Her next thriller, due in Spring 2021, focuses on some ill-prepared amateur hikers on a dangerous trek in Gros Morne.


“I’m interested in law. I’m also interested in criminal psychology, that kind of avenue, so I’m not really sure what I want to do yet,” she admits.


Among Emily’s idols are Gillian Flynn and Jodi Picoult, but she is an avid reader with plenty of solid authors she enjoys, especially when she’s writing. Along with movie trailers and music, she finds it helps her own process.


For those thinking of writing a novel, Emily says that it helps to write about anything each day, whether or not it’s relevant to the book. She considers writing to be a muscle that needs daily exercise.


“For my undergrad, I was only writing papers for the most part. So sitting down to write fiction at the end of the day, I felt useless,” she says. “But after I graduated and I started focusing, that muscle has kind of come back now. And read a lot,” she encourages.


Emily likes to get up early, grab a cup of coffee and park at her desk where she writes until noon. She tries to hit a daily word count goal in order to track her progress, normally aiming for two or three thousand but she’s happy to reach half that. Hitting the halfway mark of her book is her favourite part. Like a lot of writers, she tends to develop multiple book projects simultaneously.


“I’m working on more than one (book) at the moment,” she shrugs. “The second one is going to be a labour of love, so I’m trying not to talk about it because it’s still so subject to change, but I always have two or three ideas going at once.”


Emily tries to keep her protagonists and characters far removed from herself and people she knows. She’s says they’re a lot braver, or alternatively, much more distasteful.

“A lot of my characters aren’t the best people, so I would hope I’m not like them,” she laughs.


Signed copies of The Woman in the Attic are currently available for purchase at Butterfly Book Boutique in Port aux Basques.

  body: "CODROY VALLEY – Tracey Fowlow admits she was ill prepared for 11 students walking through her door one mid-summer Monday morning.


“That first day they walked through the door it was ‘Oh my gosh!’. What are we going to do with them?” she laughs.


Fowlow is the administrator for West Valley Farms, a large scale dairy farm that has belonged to the Cormier family for decades. West Valley Farms applies to hire two students each summer and typically gets funded for one.


This year they were granted funding to hire 10 students, aged 16 to 21, as part of the federal student summer jobs program. That application is submitted in February, but once COVID-19 hit the government amended its programs and agreed to cover 100 percent of salaries for students instead of its standard 50 percent.


“Usually you can’t change the application, and we felt with everything going on, the uncertainty, we figured let’s change it. Let’s go for ten,” recounts Fowlow. “A lot of the summer jobs are tourism. We knew that everyone has been held up in their house. We didn’t think there was going to be any tourism in our area this summer, so hence nothing for the students, so it was a reach out to help the students in our community.”


The group grew to 11 once owner Gerard Cormier realized he had forgotten his promise to hire his granddaughter.


Fowlow credits MP Gudie Hutchings (Long Range Mountains) for her efforts in helping to get the application amended and pushed through. That process lasted through most of the summer and was finalized not long before the students showed up to work.


In turn, Cormier praises Fowlow for the months of paperwork, phone calls and e-mail follow ups.


“She put a lot of work in. It didn’t come easy,” says the veteran farmer.


Even though the dairy farm is considered an essential service, he still admits to being shocked at receiving funding for 10. The farm’s staff had predicted that only half of their applications would be successful and some would only be granted part-time hours. They guessed wrong.


“It was 10 full time, 35 hours a week, for eight weeks,” says Fowlow. “It was over $32,000 in funding.”


That funding was set at minimum wage, but like he always does, Cormier topped it up a bit so the students would get $12 per hour. Farms are, by their very design, labour intensive and the students no doubt earned every penny.


In an effort to continue to support Codroy Valley through the pandemic, West Valley sent their new young employees to help out seniors in the area. That sometimes meant days of hard labour chopping and hauling wood to stockpile for the winter.


“Out of the eight weeks, we probably donated close to three weeks of the kids, just out in the community. And what a response we got from the seniors. They were just so appreciative,” recalls Cormier. “Some of those seniors are in their eighties and still burning wood.” 


Once word got around, it wasn’t long before Fowlow stopped calling seniors to ask if they needed help and started keeping a list, because the seniors had started calling in with requests. The students also worked at local churches, tending to graveyards, and cutting back overgrown hiking trails.


“It was also exciting for the kids because it gave them something different every day,” says Cormier. “Those kids, they were excited to come to work every day. They didn’t miss a day’s work.”


In helping the community, the students also helped themselves. Some of them had never before held a job, which meant no work experience to list on resumés and no job references. Now that they’ve earned both at West Valley Farms, Fowlow confirms that she’s already been contacted as a job reference, which she is more than happy to provide.

Once the community was taken care of, students went to work on the farm, painting, landscaping, bottle feeding calves or picking rocks out of freshly plowed fields in preparation for sowing. Travis Cormier says that as a result, the students themselves transformed.


“It’s a pretty hard job,” says Travis. “You’d see some of them lose weight and other ones gain strength. It was crazy.”


All three say they witnessed personal growth in the students as well. The quieter ones became more outgoing thanks to the teamwork, and as the weeks progressed and their confidence grew they began to display initiative.


“At the end of it they already knew. You didn’t have to tell them to go pick up the garbage or pick up a rake. It was more automatic,” says Travis.


Although the social distancing rules were adhered to as much as possible, in a work setting like a farm it doesn’t always prove practical. West Valley Farm was closed to the public and remains so, and that isolation helped the students build camaraderie simply because of the work bubble.


In fact, helping the valley students was the key reason the farm increased its request for their number of summer students in the first place.


“All education stopped mid-March and just the social and mental... what they had been through,” says Fowlow, who believes the sudden cut off from friends would prove jarring and stressful for the young adults. “You could hear them laughing and having fun.”


Having an influx of new employees also meant more work for the farm’s existing staff.

“If she (Fowlow) wasn’t here, somebody had to be here to direct them,” offers Cormier. “We kept them away from any hazard areas.”


Some days that was as simple as making sure there was enough gas in the tank or ordering supplies. Other days it meant health and occupational hazard training to ensure proper safety guidelines were being met. Some things the students simply weren’t allowed to do, like operating a power saw or driving heavy equipment.


Overall the experience was nothing but positive for the owners and employees of West Valley Farms. Cormier says that if he could do it all again next summer, he probably would.

“We got a lot of gratification from helping the seniors in the community,” says Cormier. Having the students allowed him to free up his employees to take on other work. “It was a benefit to us, so I wanted to share a benefit to the community.”


“We could probably plan it a bit better for next year,” grins Travis. “But we didn’t know we were going to get 10!”


“They accomplished a lot,” says Fowlow. “They did phenomenal.”

  body: "STEPHENVILLE – The College of the North Atlantic’s (CNA) Heavy Equipment Centre of Excellence re-opened to students on Monday, Aug. 24. Although the Centre had opened previously in mid-January, it was forced to suspend onsite academic instruction by mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


Funding was first announced in late summer of 2016 as a joint federal and provincial initiative, and construction began in May 2017. Both levels of government committed 9.25 million, and the College of the North Atlantic also made a significant financial contribution towards the new facility.


“Total project funding received from the federal and provincial governments was approximately $18.5 million, and that included improvements to the existing buildings at the field training site as well as the new building construction. CNA contributed an additional $1.5 million for furniture, fixtures and equipment purchases,” stated Michelle Barry, CNA’s Communications Manager.


Via e-mail, Barry stated that currently the facility can accommodate 170 students, but there is additional building capacity for future program opportunities, as well as for contract training. Multiple programs are offered at the facility under the School of Industrial Trades program.


“There is a plan to work with industry partners to conduct applied research as a leading innovative post-secondary campus. The scope of programs enables CNA to be a leader in assisting the province in defining and attaining its goals related to motive power in the areas of: technology adaption, environmental sustainability and establishing regulations in the transportation sector as new technologies emerge,” wrote Barry.


The Bay St. George campus was chosen as the site for the new facility in order to bring together all of the mechanical, technical and operational programs. The campus already enjoys an established reputation as a leader in industry training and expertise for high-volume power trades and has an array of operational programs. It is also an approved government training and assessment facility for Class 1, 3, 8, 9, 9A and Red and Blue Seal operational certificates.


An official grand opening ceremony has yet to be scheduled.

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – All councillors were present at the latest meeting of council held on Wednesday evening, Sept. 23 at the fire hall.


Charlie’s Head

A resident of the Charles Head area is asking Port aux Basques council to replace the rocks that fell down after initial repairs took place for an outfalls during the winter of 2018. Public Works had previously recommended armour stone be placed to prevent further storm surge flooding, but the work has yet to take place. Council promised to get over there as soon as possible to reinforce the shoreline.


Grand Bay West Beach 

At least three councillors found out during the meeting that a resident of Kyle Lane had dropped a package of supporting documents and photographs for council to examine. The residents are asking for a no overnight parking sign to prevent tourists from using the parking lot as a free campground.


Council has deferred the vote on the request until after all councillors have had a chance to go through the submitted materials.


Matthews Lane

Coun. Melvin Keeping initially moved for the town to assume ownership of Matthews Lane, but upon further discussion agreed to defer the vote until the next meeting of council so that the town manager could draft cost estimates.


While all members of council seem in favour of assuming ownership of the road so they can pave and plow it, there are questions surrounding how much it will cost taxpayers to have this done legally.


The town manager re-iterated that this would require seven separate surveys. In the meantime, council has promised to plow the road.


Rat project

In the Public Works report, Coun. Keeping shared that the town is applying for a pilot project to deal with the ongoing rat problem. The project would cover one section of town, and hopefully branch out from there.


Cost recovery

Mayor John Spencer shared that he has been in touch with Municipalities Newfoundland and Labrador (MNL) about the town’s petition seeking support for cost recovery. He remains concerned that the matter is not drawing enough attention from MNL, and that communities in the province don’t realize that Marine Atlantic’s cost recovery affects all of the province’s residents, not just the Southwest Coast as is commonly believed.


Fire Department report

The Channel-Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department should be receiving its new pumper truck around mid-October, reported Coun. Justin Blackler. Blackler and Deputy Mayor Todd Strickland, who is also the Deputy Fire Chief, serve as council liasons to the fire department.


Also included in the report was a recommendation to form a committee made up of councillors, Fire Chief Jerry Musseau and Deputy Fire Chief Todd Strickland, and some firefighters. The goal of the committee will be to recommend specific actions to council when it comes to the department, such as drafting fire regulations or bylaws.


CORRECTION: The council recap appearing in the Sept. 14 edition incorrectly stated that to outfit a firefighter with new bunker gear costs $1,000. In fact, the cost of new bunker gear is closer to $2,100. The Wreckhouse Weekly apologizes for the error, and any inconvenience or confusion.

  subtitles: "Gerard Cormier and Vanessa Kavanagh are working together as part of a project to help farmers offset feed costs by growing their own wheat. - © Rosalyn Roy. - © Rosalyn Roy",
  body: "CODROY VALLEY – In what is seemingly a win-win, West Valley Farms is among the dairy farms partnering with the provincial government in a pilot project to grow its own wheat. Vanessa Kavanagh is a research scientist with the Department of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture currently on site to oversee the wheat harvest, which will then be fed to some of the livestock.


“Only two percent of Newfoundland is arable – one to two percent – you can actually grow on,” notes Kavanagh. “It’s difficult to grow all of the feed supplies that we would need to feed our livestock.”


Most of the province’s livestock feed is imported – about 63,000 metric tonnes each year according to Kavanagh – and represents one of the biggest expenses for dairy farms. By planting grain and oil seeds, the hope is that farms will eventually offset those costs and perhaps even become fully self-sufficient. In return, Kavanagh collects key data about such things as growth stages, harvest yields, fertilizer trials, etc.


Kavanagh, who originally hails from Corner Brook, had been training out west and was convinced that Newfoundland could, in fact, grow its own crops including grains like wheat, barley and corn as well as oil seeds like canola or soy. She’d also been working in Norway, Scotland’s Orkney Islands and Iceland.


“They’re all growing it,” says Kavanagh. “Can Newfoundland grow it? Of course we can grow it. It’s just a matter of figuring out how to do it here.”


Growing grains here differs somewhat since Newfoundland’s climate is more similar to Northern Europe than the prairie provinces. Wheat grown in Saskatchewan, for example, is drier than the wheat grown in Newfoundland. Prior to partnering with West Valley Farms, Kavanagh successfully grew crops in Cormack, Pasadena, Daniel’s Harbour and areas on the East Coast.


“Ours is high moisture, so the thing with that is it doesn’t keep as well, so we have to do the processing a little differently, but the quality is actually much better at this stage than if we let it get to a dry stage for feeding cows,” says Kavanagh.


Growing your own wheat sounds like a no-brainer, but Kavanagh says that the initial cost can be prohibitive. A combine harvester costs somewhere around a half million dollars, and by partnering with the department, which loans out the combine and other equipment for the project, a farm can weigh the pros and cons without making that kind of upfront financial investment.


“We thought that as a government, there’s a way to offset that risk if we have the gear,” says Kavanagh. “There’s only two combines in Newfoundland right now. One of our other program participants bought the other combine.”


By renting out a combine to neighbouring farms, the owner can help offset its high cost while still allowing smaller producers who can’t afford to buy a harvester to grow their own feed. There’s also a special seeder and Kavanagh estimates there are now seven or eight of those in the province. Upgrading technology and teaching farmers to use the new equipment is one of the goals of the project.


“They’re learning it so the day we walk away they could potentially run it all themselves,” says Kavanagh.


Last year was the first year West Valley Farms signed on to grow their own wheat, planting about 50 acres.


“It works phenomenally out here. The fields are wonderful. The climate is perfect. The yields are the highest we’ve ever had,” shares Kavanagh. “This is quite a micro-climate.”

Gerard Cormier, who operates West Valley with his brother Danny, is no stranger to crops. The dairy farm already grows its own legumes, alfalfa and hay in the Codroy Valley and grows corn in St. David’s to feed its 2,000 head of cattle. Even so, it still has to import corn and other feed from the mainland.


“First we wanted a trial plot,” says Cormier. The results were so encouraging that the farm planted 260 acres this year. “We had fields where yields were down, quality was down, so this was a way of doing some kind of a rotation.”


The dual purpose wheat, AC Scotia, can be milled for flour or used as livestock feed. West Valley grew enough wheat to make 125,000 loaves of bread or just under 165,000 boxes of cereal, which Kavanagh estimates would feed about 9,000 people.


“The only negative factor is that we still don’t have enough land to be self-sufficient, even in forage,” says Cormier. “We’re still probably 500 acres short just in forage.”


Clearing land is time consuming, and once all the brush and rocks are removed the fields still has to be prepared by adding nutrients to the soil, which can take another year or two. West Valley doesn’t have much room to expand in the Codroy Valley.


Cormier says they’re hoping to put another 100 acres of wheat into production at the St. David’s location next year, which already grows about 700 acres of corn. Cormier figures just to become self-sufficient in forage crops would require about 3,000 acres of land.


“I could see us probably growing four to five hundred acres of wheat,” offers Cormier. “Anything that we can grow here, that’s a bonus.”

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Hurricane Teddy didn’t do as much damage as initially projected. At its peak, the wind blew sea foam across the roads, damaged some siding and pitched rocks the size of soccer balls up onto the driveway of the home belonging to Danielle Clarke and Richard Spencer.


Thankfully their home, which is all of five feet from the sea, didn’t suffer any damage.The large boulders protecting the roads were put in place years ago by the town and took the worst of the storm’s brunt. Still the waves did manage deposit a bit of debris onto their lawn.


“There’s a bit of garbage out here today, a bit of foam and stuff, a bit of driftwood,” notes Spencer.


Spencer recalls other storms that did far more damage than Teddy. He was asleep in one basement when a freak storm surge washed out a neighbour’s basement.


“I didn’t wake up,” he says.


Although they came through the storm unscathed, Clarke says these are some of the biggest waves she’s seen.


“When the waves came in, they were washing up to the shed. I have not seen it that close,” she admits.


The shed is roughly six feet from their house.


The only thing that bothers the couple when it comes to storms is the mess, but that’s not really a big deal either. The town always comes around the next day and cleans the rocks from the driveway.

  subtitles: "",
  body: "Dear Editor,

After reading the Wreckhouse Weekly on Aug. 24, 2020 and the article entitled “Matador Mining makes progress”, I have some thoughts and questions. 


Before I state those, I’d like to start with: how long does 10 years feel like? How connected are you to the place you live? How do we define progress in an age of ever increasing awareness of social, environmental and sustainability issues? 


Matador Mining states that they will “continue to work with various stakeholders including outfitters, special interest groups and indigenous communities and will continue to work with the public to mitigate concerns.” Mitigate concerns sounds co-operative but also makes me question their statement.


How will Matador mitigate the destruction of entire ecosystems or the poisoning of area watersheds? How will they communicate with all Indigenous people or communities? How will Matador communicate laterally and equally with all stakeholders when the land itself is a stakeholder? 


In the article, it states that Matador will host public meetings to address concerns only after federal and provincial governments environmental guidelines have been met; that is, only after they are prepared to go ahead. 


If we look to the practices of extractive industry, it’s not hard to see the destruction left in its wake. Look to British Columbia, where in 2015, thousands of gallons of slurry burst into Polley Lake, from the Mount Polley Gold Mine, ruining the watershed. 


Recently, the actions of Canadian company Barrick Gold led to several cyanide spills into rivers in Argentina, including a spill of over a million litres. Between 1908 and 1939, a Canadian company released several hundred thousand tonnes of gold mine tailings over the land in Sudbury, Ontario. Eighty-one years later, the region is still coping with the elevated arsenic levels in the water, to say nothing of the upgrades required to the containment facility. 


Tailings ponds are known to be extraordinarily pollutive. Tailings are an aqueous slurry of mine wastes that require perpetual containment, and must be dumped and stored in water. The contaminants can be transported by wind and water to cover an even larger distance. We’ve all seen how far salt spray can be carried – imagine the evaporation of water and picture Wreckhouse winds over a tailings pond. 


Run off is very often acidic, which dissolves heavy metals like mercury. However, highly acidic run-off is one of the very highest forms of mining related pollution. It is not uncommon that metal contaminants from mining activity settle into soils. These metals are not biodegradable and the soil is contaminated for generations. 


We are all connected to the land that Matador intends to mine. What are the real, tangible benefits of a project like this? The mine will certainly provide a few jobs locally, and create economic spinoffs through local procurement. However, with a project lifespan of ten years consider the true legacy of the project. 


How does resource extraction affect the way that people see the land to which they belong? Do we see the value in unblemished ecosystems, healthy for future generations, or do we look only to benefit ourselves? Do we give consideration to the plants and animals, or are we the top of the food chain? 


I also wonder where the benefits (which is to say, the money) from the Matador Mine project will really go? Some products will be purchased here on the island, there will be some menial, short term jobs. But Australia is an entire world away, and while the company states that they’ve hired other companies from St. John’s and Gander to work in the field here, how far will 10 years of work really go locally? Even if they do meet their environmental responsibilities and do a few years of remediation work, the land will never be the same. No one will recognize the land after a gold mine tosses it aside. 

 

If the Southwestern community is really to be invested in, wouldn’t subsidy in local people, businesses and agencies with an eye to the future, sustainability and caring for this place be reasonable to act on? 


As John Spencer, the Mayor of Port-Aux-Basques says in his letter to the editor appearing in the same edition, “don’t just show up, do more.” It is simply not enough to say that industry is important or that the project will infuse money into Southwest Newfoundland. It’s not enough when the activity that will bring money will also completely alter, beyond repair, the very land that we call home. Today’s and our future youth are the ones who will have to deal with the leftovers after Matador is long gone. We are part of this natural network. 


Do more and look farther than 10 years, take the long view. And do better. Port aux Basques has been working hard to become a destination and to encourage people to stay — more investment in the community will do just that.",

But maybe we have become a little TOO used to it all. 


I am constantly on the go around the Southwest Coast, and I couldn’t begin to count the number of times that I have been forced to back up, or turn around, or even leave a location due to improper social distancing. 


A great many people don’t seem to understand that just because you have a mask on doesn’t mean you can walk too close to someone. Just because I have a mask on doesn’t mean you can brush by me in a doorway or an aisle.
The six foot rule hasn’t been abandoned, but it has been forgotten or ignored. 


It’s not uncommon to see someone exiting our post office down the ramp way, which is clearly marked as an entrance only. I’ve even been yelled and cursed at for pointing this out to one customer, in front of my young son no less.


I regularly see workers without masks on at their locations. Granted, most are behind a shield of some sort, but not all have that barrier. 


If we want to get back to normal, it's more important than ever to not act as though we are already there. ",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Port aux Basques’ reputation for being autism friendly has helped give at least one autistic person the confidence to share their talents and interests.


Josh Savery, 29, moved here with his parents, Lloyd and Peggy in July, 2019. Josh was diagnosed to be on the autism spectrum when he was 18 years old, but don’t let that fool you. He has a high IQ, is a talented abstract painter and writer, and tends to think scientifically.


Even though he was raised by a very loving family, growing up was very difficult for him. His parents remember that Josh was bullied from a very young age for being ‘different’. One challenge was his thirst for knowledge that is still a part of him as an adult.


“As soon as he started speaking he started asking questions. He never took anything at face value and you always had to prove what you said. He never believed you just because you were an adult. He was very inquisitive and his most common question was “Why?” which often drove us crazy. He was our first child and we had nothing to compare him to,” says his mother


Josh has held down jobs since the day he left high school.


He first worked in a small meat packing plant and worked his way up rather quickly to become manager. He stayed in that role for a few years but struggled with the very early hours. His next job was at a veterinarian hospital where he remained for many years, only leaving when the family moved.


Not one to share his feelings, his mother says he seemed to like working there as he worked mostly with the animals. 


For those four or five years Josh traveled with a team of veterinarians from all over the world. They went to remote places to provide medical care to animals on behalf of an organization called GAAP (Global Alliance for Animals and People). The last couple of years they went to Guatemala where they drove for a day and set up a medical camp in a very remote area.


Peggy remembers that, “Josh always came back from these trips completely different, very talkative and happy. I was told by the vets he went with that he worked very hard on these trips and was a totally different person socially.”


After moving to Port aux Basques, Josh took an interest in baking bread. Instead of asking his mother to teach him, he began to research the science behind how bread is formed, starting with the creation of yeast. He now uses very expensive flours, some of which cannot be sourced locally.


He grows his own yeast and uses additional ingredients that makes his bread unique. He does not measure in the usual way – he measures by weight or with a certain percentage to make sure it is exactly the amount he needs. Things have to be done in this manner since many autistic people are not satisfied with their result unless it is done to perfection. The texture, colour and the interaction of grains is how Josh evaluates his final product.


Peggy says that Josh is not interested in making money. His main goal is to bake different kinds of bread for people to enjoy. In the beginning, his parents would buy all his ingredients and then just give away his baked goods to the neighbours.


Autism Involves Me (AIM) helps by financing the cost of his ingredients and First Choice Convenience sells Josh’s baked goods to their customers. Bread starts at $3.00 and the money is donated to AIM. Peggy says that Josh is very happy with this setup since he does not have to go to the store or interact with people.


Savery’s customers are increasing daily. They are now asking for personal orders, including requests for sourdough bread.


Jeannette Tobin, owner of First Choice Convenience, reports that the bread sells very quickly.


“We have a customer who buy three loaves at a time.”


Peggy has already seen a positive change in her son. She says has become much happier and is very comfortable and content.


“He loves Newfoundland and the people. He finds them more real and caring. He has become much more social with us.”

  subtitles: "Arthur and Debbie Ryan of Mountain Top Outfitters are among the tourism businesses hit hard by COVID-19. - © Rosalyn Roy",
  body: "CODROY VALLEY – There is an enticing smell of freshly baked homemade bread wafting through the Silver Sands restaurant. Rows of golden loaves, still warm to the touch, line the kitchen island countertop, but while some will get shipped into a hunting camp belonging to Mountain Top Outfitters, others will be frozen and likely served for personal consumption.


Like so many other companies dependent on tourism, Mountain Top Outfitters is struggling this year. So is the Silver Sands Restaurant, which benefits greatly by providing food to the outfitters and serving tourists who roll through area every year from August through December.


The two businesses, which have been operating for decades, are owned and operated by Arthur and Debbie Ryan. Arthur started working as a guide in his father’s outfitting business before he was even a teenager. Debbie usually serves as a guide and a cook, often preparing food for the camps in the Silver Sands kitchen.


About 20 years ago after taking over the company, Arthur began expanding Mountain Top Outfitting, eventually establishing nine camps in various areas around the Southwest Coast.

“It’s destroyed this year,” says Arthur about his tourism. “I think it’s about 200 hunters I lost.”


Most of Arthur’s hunters are Americans, and there are Canadians from Ontario and Quebec who come each year. He has managed to accommodate a few from within the Atlantic bubble after some targeted advertising, but not many. He’s been offering a significant reduction in his pricing because at this point he’s just looking to reduce his losses and stay afloat until things get back to normal.


Thankfully his hunters seem to be on board.


“I give them a choice. Do they want a deposit returned or do they want to carry over to next year?,” offers Arthur. Some choose to get reimbursed but for now most would rather defer to next year. “They want to carry over because they’re scared that if they don’t carry over they won’t get a spot next year. They might have to wait two or three years.”


The couple have been hoping that hunters from Ontario and Quebec will be able to come in for what remains of the season, but there has been a recent uptick of COVID-19 cases reported in both of those provinces. Fearing a resurgence or a second wave, officials there are already debating more lockdowns.


“We’re desperate to try to salvage something,” admits Arthur. “With Ontario, Quebec and Alberta we’ve probably got a third, maybe a quarter, of our hunters – probably 50 or 60. But if they don’t open that up I’ve got to start sending deposits back again.”


Over and above the concern for their own operation, the Ryans are worried for their staff and businesses that benefit from their hunters. Butchers that handle the game meats, gas stations and stores that supply the outfitters are also being hit because the hunters just can’t come.


“You’ve probably got, just in this general area, this valley, there’s probably 600 hunters come in here through outfitters,” estimates Arthur. “This is where the money comes. It stays in this valley. We spend it here.”


Mountain Top spends anywhere from $50 to $60 thousand every year for its camp, and because he had planned on building, Arthur figures that would have likely increased to $100 thousand to gear up had this season gone as planned.


“There was going to be a lot of extra stuff and (we) just dropped it to nil,” he says. “A lot of outfitters going bankrupt.”


Arthur says that’s not his personal opinion, but that he’s been reaching out via the Outfitters Association and learned that there are operators that cannot continue because of this lost season.


“That’s ones that invested in the last two or three years,” shares Arthur. “They put everything on the line and they’re finished. They’re gone.”


That represents a significant blow for what was, prior to COVID-19, a healthy tourism business for not only the region but for the province. American tourism means an influx of American dollars into the Canadian economy from the moment hunters cross the border until they leave.


Arthur says the government has offered some help by offering a loan with deferred payments, but he’s not interested in taking on another payment, even if it only starts two years from now. Also, he’s never had government help for his business before and he’s not looking for it now.


“They're talking about some kind of a wage subsidy, but you know a wage subsidy when you can’t hire anybody on, what’s the good of a wage subsidy?” he asks rhetorically. “There’s no work for them. There’s very little.”


During the season’s peak, Mountain Top will employ about 30 people. This year the outfitter has managed to retain only four.


Arthur admits that if the pandemic had struck in January instead he’d have not bothered with the season at all. By laying in supplies to repair the camps he took on payments that he still has to make with or without the hunters.


“If I go under I go under,” says Arthur, who won’t speculate on the future. “I don’t know. I just take it a day at a time.”


Also worrying the Ryans is the Wilderness and Ecological Reserves Advisory Council’s (WERAC) plan to expand protected areas in the region, including those where he has some of his camps. He fears that once the areas are designated as environmentally protected, he won’t be able to repair his camps anymore or drive his ATVs in and out with tourists and supplies.


“I phoned that group, WERAC, and said, ‘Am I going to be allowed to hunt in Cape St. John?’,” recalls Arthur. “And they wouldn’t answer me.”


WERAC has come under fire recently in the media for its plan to classify 32 areas of the province as protected, prompting more than one group to dedicate a Facebook page to stopping them. The plan is not yet implemented, however, and will require numerous public meetings before the provincial government will make a final decision about those areas.",

  body: "Classie Marshall can still remember the excitement she felt on her first day to school when she was six years old. She also started haymaking at this same age. The sixth child in a family of fourteen children, Classie was born on Oct. 19, 1932 in Cape Ray.


“I wanted to go with my parents and mom told me I had to carry something so I carried the rake,” recalls Classie.


These became her favourite outings and the family would walk several miles tending to the hay for the winter feed.


“I loved haymaking and I went every year until I left home.”


Cape Ray was a small but busy community. The railway still rolled through back then and had hired four men to maintain the tracks. Others still were fishers, but most raised cattle, grew their own vegetables or cut firewood. Marshall’s father worked on the train tracks at Gaff Topsail’s (Wreckhouse area) every summer.


Says Classie, “There were no toys. We played ball, spent time on the beach, snow sliding in the winter and we always had to help with the chores.”


Classie started working when she was fourteen. She went to Trinity for six months to help her sister, who was having a baby. Afterwards she went to Howley to help her aunt with her newborn. The following autumn, she moved to Margaree to work for her cousin who had a ‘milk leg’, a colloquialism for an infected leg, after her third child was born.


“I got the train at Middle Barachois and went to Port aux Basques. Then I got on a skiff to take me to Margaree. My cousin was in bed for two months and I had to look after her three children, as well as her and her husband. I was suppose to be a serving girl but I was more of a little nurse.”


She then looked after two more expectant mothers in Margaree – Mrs. Ingram and Mrs. Walters. After she was finished at Mrs. Ingram’s, Classie wanted to go home but since it was winter the community was pretty much cut off.


“The only way home would be by walking. They wouldn’t let me walk by myself so I had to wait and see if Reverend Martin walked down for his church service,” says Classie.


By the time he got down, she was already working for the Walters’ family.


Finally, at sixteen years old, she got a ride on the mail boat back to Port aux Basques to work as a servant girl. She can still picture herself sailing in to the cove where the Town Council is now located. With a twinkle in her eye, Classie tells the story of her true love.


“I met Albert on the veranda of Harry Tom’s Restaurant. In July of the next year I went to Halifax and worked in Simpson’s (Sears) to work in the cafeteria. Albert was in Toronto working as a welder. He came down to visit me and we got engaged. Then, when I was eighteen years old, I went to Toronto and we were married in 1952. I worked in the Royal York Hotel as a waitress and my first child was born in Toronto.”


The Marshall family moved back to town in 1954 and Classie began working at the restaurant in the railway station. In 1966 she was the first manager of Bob’s Chicken Coop where she worked for 26 years. During her tenure she taught the trade to her daughter, Bonnie, until she retired at 58 years of age.


Classie says that she felt Port aux Basques was a great place to raise her five children. Four of their children still live in Port aux Basques. You may see her anytime with one of them berry picking or walking the Grand Bay West beach, still enjoying the great outdoors.


“They were free to move around. I did not worry about them getting kidnapped”.


Now retired, Classie is just as busy volunteering as when she was working. She is a member of the Hospital Auxiliary, The Royal Canadian Legion, the Fifty Plus Club and the Anglican Church Women. She and her husband spent a lot of time in the woods fishing trout, hunting moose, berry picking and trapping rabbits in the winter. 


 “After we retired, Albert and I would walk 25 or 26 km to our camp at Stagg Hill. We would stay overnight and then walk back the same distance the next day. It got much better when we bought a trike and then a quad.”


Classie also keeps busy by knitting and sewing, including many homemade quilts.

She says the town has really progressed over the years, and feels very thankful for tall of the new amenities and the development of new streets and housing. However, she does have a request for the Town employees.


“As a senior, I would like to tell the Town Council to tell the plow operators to stop plowing snow in front of my car after I have it just shovelled.”


Classie also has a suggestion for the younger generation. 


“Stay in school and get a good education. In this age of technology, you might need a degree to get a permit to catch a fish!”

  body: "CODROY VALLEY – The growing number of seals in the Grand Codroy River has some residents worried about the potential impact on the estuary, which is is an internationally recognized RAMSAR protected wetland. The wetland is home to bird species that are found nowhere else in Newfoundland and attracts tourists who visit the province specifically to watch the birds.


“Obviously it affects it if they’re eating the fish, and it is a salmon river,” says Claudelle Devoe, owner/operator of Codroy Valley Cottage Country. “We’ve been here 17 years. They’ve never been here before that.”


Devoe’s cabins are nestled immediately beside the river, and this is not the first time she’s seen seals. Back in 2017 she sent pictures into the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), which identified them as harbour seals and assured her that they would not negatively impact the birds. At that time only a few seals were in the river, but Devoe has recently counted up to 80 resting on a nearby sandbar and is worried the growing number means less fish for the birds.


“How many more are we going to get and what are the effects going to be?” asked Devoe. “We used to have eel fishermen here years ago, but they don’t come here anymore. They’re probably eating everything here.”


There is no cause to worry about the birds or the impact on the river says Garry Stenson, a Research Scientist and the Head of the Marine Mammal and Science Branch with DFO.

“Seals are part of a natural eco-system,” says Stenson via phone interview. “Historically harbour seals are not uncommon on the West Coast. We’ve got data from bounty returns that goes back to the 40s and 50s.”


Though Stenson cannot identify for sure what species is currently in the Grand Codroy River without examining photos, grey seals in the area wouldn’t be uncommon either. Colonies of harbour seals have been regularly reported along this coast and particularly in the Port au Port peninsula since the 70s.


Grey seals don’t winter in Newfoundland and the vast majority breed on Sable Island, and only a small proportion of the overall number will return in late spring. Most of the seals observed on the West Coast are harbour seals.


“Harbour seals were reduced significantly through bounty programs and hunting. Since about the early 1970s they’ve been protected,” notes Stenson. “Harbour seals tend to be more resident in the sense that they’ll stick around the same area for much of the year. They don’t migrate the way the other seals do.”


They’re also more easily observed because unlike other species of seals they tend to haul themselves out on land around low tide. Stenson says that harbour seals tend to eat a variety of small fish and invertebrates, particularly the sand lance.


“It’s a real mix,” admits Stenson. “They’ll move into a river if there’s a good amount of food available.”


He also says there’s no evidence that the seals are having a negative impact on the salmon population. Research on harp seals in the Notre Dame Bay area where they were hanging around a salmon river revealed they weren’t eating the smolt, but were actually focused on the herring swimming near the mouth of the river.


“I’ve talked to our salmon people about the Grand River, and from what I can gather from them, they don’t have a lot of information on the Grand Codroy itself but the rivers in the area are not showing anything unusual,” says Stenson.


If the seals were having an impact on the fish, the river itself would differ noticeably from nearby surrounding rivers, and that’s not currently the case in the Grand Codroy River. Researchers with DFO have collectors in the area who gather materials for further study, including the occasional seal, so that its stomach contents can be examined.


Still, data on the harbour seals has taken a back seat to research on seals elsewhere, something Stenson hopes to remedy soon.


“We don’t have very good estimates of harbour seal numbers. We’re working on that,” says Stenson.


Currently he’s in year two of a shoreline study of seals in Atlantic Canada, which is a massive undertaking. Last year the study took a look at seals along the coastline of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and this year it was Nova Scotia’s Bay of Fundy. Next year’s plan is to tackle Newfoundland.


“They did do the west coast of Newfoundland last year,” says Stenson.


Researchers used a plane to fly around the Southwest corner looking for seals in June, just after the pupping period, but there were no seals observed in Codroy. Stenson says that although there isn’t much data, he estimates the harbour seal population somewhere around 30 thousand to 40 thousand animals in all of Atlantic Canada, with most based in the Bay of Fundy.


“We know that the seals belong there,” says Stenson. “They’re part of a normal ecosystem.”

 Although they may be part of the ecosystem, not all of the observers watching them sun on sandbars in the Grand Codroy seem excited that the seals are growing in number on the Grand Codroy River.


“The tourists love looking at them but the locals hate them,” notes Devoe.


For those who have taken to seal watching, DFO welcomes data about the Grand Codroy River population. This could be as simple as someone doing a head count while sitting outside on their balcony or even just once a week on their Sunday morning walk, around low tide.


“We’re always interested in information,” says Stenson. “When do they start seeing them? When do they leave? How long are they there for? Are they there for a month? Are they there for two months? That’s the kind of thing that helps us understand what they’re doing.”


Anyone wishing to send in information and photos can email Garry at garry.stenson@dfo-mpo.gc.ca.

  body: "ISLE AUX MORTS – On Monday, Aug. 10 the town of Isle aux Morts held a regular meeting of council. Here are a few of the highlights.


Harvey’s Gravesite

The town has received permission from property owners to post a sign on their fence pointing the way to the George Harvey grave site.


Culvert repairs

In order to repair the culvert on Barchois Road, council solicited a number of quotes. The accepted quote for aluminum to repair the culvert was $2,733.92.

The other quotes received were given for 12” culverts instead of 8”, but because these are too big the culvert for Cross Road will be ordered at a later date. Council also noted that the culvert on Ben’s Road requires repair.


Walking track

Deputy Mayor Tonya Harvey discussed the walking track on the slipway and ideas she had for improvements. Among these were suggestions for more sods, a sitting area, a flower garden and a community garden.


New quad

Mayor Nelson Lillington spoke about the need for a new quad, which is used to maintain the town’s trails. The old one is second hand, 12 years old and had been out of service for about three weeks. After examining three separate quotes and acceptable models, council decided to purchase a 2020 Yamaha Kodiak 450 EPS for $10,120.


Leave of absence

Coun. Steve LeFrense is currently on a three-month leave of absence. He informed council that that he may move to Port aux Basques.",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – A green pipe raised some eyebrows and caused some pinched nostrils when it was spotted early last week near High Street. Many towns in this province lack proper treatment plants and continue to dump untreated sewage into the storm sewers, waterways and the Atlantic Ocean, including this pipe in Grand Bay Bottom.


The federal Wastewater System Effluent Regulations means Port aux Basques is actively preparing for upgrades that will provide required primary and secondary treatment of sanitary effluent, confirms town manager Leon MacIsaac.


“The sanitary (green) piping currently exposed will be connected to this new system in the coming weeks,” advised MacIsaac via email. “The Grand Bay Bottom Sanitary Sewer System project, which currently has Phase I approved and awarded, extends from the BCJ/Rowe Street area to the Irving/Tim Hortons area of High Street. Work on this project is expected to start in the coming weeks.”


MacIsaac clarified that work in the area thus far was undertaken by town staff to separate the sanitary line connections from the storm sewer system in preparation for the project.

Responding to further inquiries, MacIsaac noted that provincial staff observed taking photographs in the area were doing so on behalf of the town, and not to report the sewage outflow to the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Municipalities.


“The Provincial staff were in the area to take pictures of the existing culvert system as part of a request from the town to utilize existing stormwater structure to complement the installation of the sanitary system. The town has not received correspondence from any Provincial or Federal departments expressing concern of the work being completed in the area,” wrote MacIsaac.


Mayor John Spencer also responded to inquiries via email, stating that, “Before town initiated change to include sanitary sewer and storm sewer, all sewers on upper side were going into storm. Now, with partnership between Federal/Provincial/Town sanitary will be collectively contained similar to other locations around town.”


The mayor also observed that separation of storm water from sanitary effluent will also provide a more realistic measurement of exactly how much municipalities will be expected to treat when the second phase gets implemented, and that the expense means the town does not want rainwater going through the treatment. But that’s still a little while away yet.

Wrote Spencer, “The municipality is a long ways from the treatment stage.",

  body: "Everybody needs a hobby. Mine, as I may have alluded to in the past, is fishing. 

There is something peaceful about it that keeps me craving the next cast. Something that keeps me thinking about nothing else except the next cast. 


We all know that the southwest corner of Newfoundland is home to some pretty spectacular scenery, but I think that the leisure fishing in our area is woefully underrated. 


I am not a fussy man. I will throw my line wherever I think I might get a bite. Whether it is fishing for trout, cod, or pollock, for me it is less about what I bring home and more about how fun it is to get something on the line. 


 I don’t own a quad or a boat, so my options are fairly limited when it comes to access to some spots I’d like to try, but that also means I get to walk, explore, and take in some amazing sights that some might not ever get to see.


I have hiked into some pretty remote locations, and seen a lot of beauty just by pausing to have a long look around. Having a photographers eye doesn’t hurt either I suppose, but finding a pond thats so flat that it reflects perfectly can certainly be appreciated by anyone. 

Unlike some, I prefer to go fishing on my own.


I have taken my father salmon fishing in the Codroy Valley, but usually I much prefer to be alone in my own thoughts. Sadly we struck out that day, but it was wonderful to go out with him, and have him try to teach me how to use a fly rod, a skill I cannot seem to master.


This past summer, I have shifted my focus from pond and brook fishing for trout to trying for saltwater trout.


They are a much more fun fish to hook into, not to mention tastier and bigger. That said, I have indeed found that a lot of my favourite spots end up being low in numbers later in the season, so casting into saltwater fishing just made more sense for me personally. Some of you may have seen me this summer in one or two of my not so secret spots.


I spent most of my time this year concentrating my efforts along Route 470, that meandering road to Rose Blanche. Not only does it offer the prettiest spots you can hike into, you can also throw a line just about as soon as you get out of your car. There are literally dozens upon dozens of ponds and brooks. 


Much like other fishermen the world over, I have my secret fishing holes, known only to myself and my young son. I could choose to share one or two with you, but as Mayor John Spencer once told me when I asked him about a spot, “A good fisherman never tells!”


So I guess l will just keep my fishing holes to myself, and you will just have to go out and try to find your own.

MOON CYCLES: On Monday, Oct. 5, the moon is in Taurus. On Tuesday it is in Gemini and will remain there until Thursday, Oct. 8, where the moon will then move into Cancer until Saturday, Oct. 11. Finally on Sunday, Oc. 11 the moon will be in Leo. If you have any of these signs in your chart you will the full effect on that particular day.


Aries – That tough guy attitude isn’t fooling anyone these days. Get a grip and take a breath. Last week was hard and this one will test you just as much. Practice stargazing and the outdoors. Success is due in your work and financial aspects, but don’t take this to heart.


Taurus – Mess with the bull and you get the horns. Are you irritated? Anger is acceptable but not mature. Take this time to practice patience and wisdom, because it really does make perfect. Focus on mental stimulation – maybe kick back and read a book.


Gemini – Travel is in the future. Whether it be planning or doing – but heed caution as Mars isn’t your friend right now. Emotions are at high tide and you don’t need any more loose ends. Practice isolation and relaxation.


Cancer – This week is tough. You may need a shoulder to lean on. Don’t burn bridges you may want to cross again later. Practice and focus on others and the act of being selfless. Release and relax. The benefits are sure to outweigh the consequences.


Leo – The high rolling has caught up with you. You are feeling gloomy this week, however, for not much reason. Do not overthink matters. You are your own worst enemy. Practice meditation this week, as it will come in your favour.


Virgo – Happiness is on the rise. Good things come and good things go. This week will be very fortunate for you. Take it with a grain of salt because sometimes things are too good to be true. Not everyone who speaks to you is your friend. Focus on your home life. 


Libra – Luck and financial gains are on the schedule for the week, dear Libra. Use this to your advantage. Slow down and smell the roses. You’ll be surprised what hidden treasures you can find. Focus on nature at this time.


Scorpio – The bad may outweigh the good at times, but that certainly isn’t the case this week. Your chances will soar as will your reputation. Word of mouth is both your best and worst enemy. Focus on vocal control. Not every story needs to be told. 


Sagittarius – Laughter and tears are on the ride this week and that’s a good thing. Look around and see who is in your corner – focus on them. Do unto others as you’d want done to yourself. Practice teamwork and relationship building this week.


Capricorn – Slow down Cap! You are not a superhero, nor will you be. Act like yourself instead of how you think you should act. How you perceive yourself is vastly different than how others perceive you. However, you do not have a bad name, nor a bad reputation. Work on your social skills.


Aquarius – Love is right up your alley and you’re out shopping. Remember, not everyone has good intentions. Don’t be an airhead, but open your eyes and prepare for happiness. Practice self-love. 


Pisces – Your week is significantly better than last since things are opening up and going your way for once. Keep up the good work and things will continue. Focus on vulnerability this week. ",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – On one side of his driveway, Walter Poole Jr. or ‘Jun’ as his friends call him, has planted an array of flowering shrubs, plants and flowers. On the other side of the driveway, flanking the pathway leading up to his front door, there are still more, so many that he can’t always remember what some of them are exactly.


One he can’t identify is a mossy-like green shrub that feels as soft as dog fur. He calls it ‘the wig’. There are still more he can wax poetic on once prompted, about the colours they will soon display. There are various rocks here and there, from chunks of white quartz to shiny grey stones, all carefully placed to provide some small contrast.


Some of his plants come from local hardware stores, others from the Codroy Valley and well beyond. Even this late in September his yard remains a stunning array of glorious colours, textures and scents.


Jun figures he’s been gardening for at least 40 years, including more than 20 at this current garden.


“You gotta have patience. You gotta have a good, strong back, and you gotta have money,” he chuckles.


Jun’s favourite fertilizer is blood meal or bone meal. Some plants take so well to his care that he has no choice but to split them off and transplant them elsewhere in the garden, or sometimes he will give them away. Every now and again people will ask him for clippings from a plant they like, but he’s careful about that, not wanting to damage the flowers. 


One neighbour visits during walks almost daily just to linger and admire Jun’s garden. He jokes that he’s going to start growing marijuana plants to entice others.


“Water it every week for the first year,” offers Jun by way of advice. “If it rained here for two days, I could come out the day after or the next day and that ground is dry.”


New plants need large amounts of water. He also says most people don’t dig their holes big enough for their transplants, and advises clearing all the grass away to three or even four times the plant’s circumference. Grass will choke a plant’s roots, says Jun.


Now that fall is here and the cooler weather is on the horizon, Jun’s garden will slowly retreat until the spring thaw. Surprisingly enough, he doesn’t wrap them any of them in burlap for the winter months.


“If they don’t grow, they gotta go,” is his motto.

Rev. Joan Allen of St. James Anglican Church oversees seven locations, and says they have a caretaker who works the Barachois Hills location ‘very well’. In addition, that same caretaker tends to the High Street location (Old Anglican cemetery across from the Marine Atlantic overpass) approximately twice a year, tending mostly to the mowing of the graveyard. 


 “And if theres anything else that needs to be done, and it’s brought to our attention, and this caretaker can take care of it, we will do it “, adds Allen. 


Sometimes it’s not just the grass that needs care either. Rev. Allen cites a recent example.


“Someone called from Halifax and the headstones were down and one was cracked off. But they’re not our responsibility, they are the responsibility of the family members. So all I did was call the funeral home, because they do have a guy who goes around and fixes them.”

Notes Allen, “They don’t charge a lot unless theres a lot of work or a big fix.”


Given that the terrain of the Southwest coast is often tilted, even toppled headstones can be a frequent issue. The old Anglican cemetery has several markers that have fallen down over the years, and without family members to take care of them, they all too often are simply left as they are. 


“This lady, she had two headstones, they had both fallen over, and they both got fixed,” shares Allen.


Maurice Collins of the Salvation Army says that they currently tend to one cemetery along the highway and one in East End Channel on Lillington Avenue. 


“We do have a summer student who maintains the cemeteries all the time,” says Collins.

The student is hired through a government grant program to allow them to take care of the properties. Collins adds that the older cemetery has very few graves remaining.

“Most have been moved up to the new cemetery.”


He admits that not much maintenance has been done in the Lillington Avenue cemetery this summer due to a lack of resources. With an aging population in the church, just finding volunteers to help out can be another challenge. 


Rev. Allen says the maintenance of the St. James Anglican cemeteries is not funded through grants at all, and says that the Anglican church hasn't received a Government grant in several years.


“Its primarily through donations or memoriams,” states Allen. 


She adds that the personal items left at graves can be an issue when it comes to maintenance as the caretaker must move each item, then clear the site, and replace the items back as best he can. 


“He hasn't got time to move everything and put it back. If you are going to put something there, you have to be responsible for making sure that the grass stays cut.”


Joan Chiasson is with the United Church. Their cemetery maintenance this summer was supported by an AMPLIFY 2020 grant which provides up to $3000 for projects by young adults. Chiasson shared via email that at their cemetery on the TransCanada Highway this year, they, “added landscaping, a parking lot and a cremation burial site,” as well as 11 benches donated in memory of loved ones.


Referring to the old cemetery near Sharks Cove, Chiasson wrote, “This cemetery was in very poor condition being overgrown by brush and weeds.”


They also found that a lot of the headstones had been knocked down over the years. 

Their church hired an employee, Jared Butt, who “did a wonderful job in cutting the brush, mostly with hand clippers, to find many hidden headstones and family plots. He also reopened the pathways so one can now walk through the cemetery.” 


Chiasson says she is looking at this as year one of a three year project. 


“The United Church’s goal is to bring the cemetery back to a place where relatives can go and remember their loved ones from many years ago,” notes Chaisson. “There is quite a bit of history hidden under all the brush and weeds.”

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – As part of their annual Fire Prevention Week program, the Channel-Port aux Basque Volunteer Fire Department visits the elementary, high school and college campus. For the past two years they’ve even started visiting the local daycare so that even the pre-schoolers will learn that firemen dressed in bunker gear are there to help.


“Usually we do a presentation to the younger kids on all fire safety, and each year we link it to our theme, but we also stick to the smoke detectors and the fire extinguishers and having an escape plan with the younger ones. After that we usually do an inspection of all those buildings,” says Fire Chief Jerry Musseau. “We have to send a report to the schools and the college, and we also do fire drills in all those places.”


However thanks to COVID-19, this will mark the first year that the fire department will not be able to visit the schools to go to different classrooms to interact with the students directly. Although they fully understand and agree that the the pandemic guidelines must be adhered to for everyone’s safety, the department is worried about how to share their message and safety tips.


“We really don’t know what we can do,” admits Musseau. “We can’t even have an open house.”


The department has been reaching out to the local schools to try to come up with a strategy that might work, but as of publication deadline no update had been made available.

This year’s theme is about fire safety in the kitchen, and Musseau says that the focus is always on teaching kids at school so they can take it home to put into practice. Usually that involves something as simple as getting them to go home and double check the smoke detectors with their parents.


“Stop drop and roll is another one,” offers Fire Captain John Collier. “We usually give them a little bag filled with crayons and books and stuff on firefighting.”


Because the department had anticipated that they wouldn’t be allowed to visit the classrooms, they didn’t even order the swag bag items. Musseau says he doesn’t know if it was even an option to just drop the materials for the school to hand out.


“COVID-19 has put a stop to everything now.”

  subtitles: "Charlene Blackmore says she will miss working at the Gulf News office.- submitted",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – For the better part of the last 17 years, Charlene Blackmore was a fixture at the Gulf News.


When SaltWire Inc., which owns the publication, announced in June that it was laying off more employees, Blackmore was one of those impacted.


Blackmore, who has taken to working temporarily as an inshore fisher while she re-evaluates her options, returned just before mid-September to help shutter the Gulf News office permanently. She admits she can’t help but feel a little melancholy.


“I loved it there,” she says candidly.


Blackmore has witnessed and adapted to many changes in the newspaper business over the years, especially when it came to technology.


“When we first started there was no internet,” she recalls. “Everything was fax. That’s how you contacted people. Pictures were all done on film, so you never knew what pictures were going to come out in the paper until you saw it on Monday.”


Stories would be typed up, accompanying film rolls and other components like mockups for ads or featured story pages would be couriered off on Thursday evenings for actual layout and printing in Grand Falls.


“Sometimes we’d get a call from Grand Falls on Friday that they never got the envelope,” says Blackmore.


That would lead to a mad scramble of phone calls trying to track down the package. Stories, obituaries and other content would be typed up and faxed in but the missing photos couldn’t be. More than once the envelope would end up in St. John’s and have to be turned around, usually reaching its destination on the Saturday.


“You just had to hope for the best,” shrugs Blackmore.


Back then the office had four permanent staff and would usually hire on a summer student to help cover all the news in and around the Southwest Coast.


Then there were the freelancers in La Poile and Ramea. Blackmore would type up their stories and get that into the envelope too.


At its zenith, the newspaper had 33 paper carriers around the region. Blackmore says it got a little hectic at times, just trying to keep everything organized.


“I had a carrier in Francois, Grey River. I had two in Ramea. I had two in Burgeo,” she recalls. “Grand Bruit for a while until they closed down. La Poile, two in Rose Blanche, two in Burnt Islands, two in Isle aux Morts, Margaree, Codroy Valley and South Branch. The majority, always 14, were in Port aux Basques.”


The internet and new software tools meant a significant shift in how the paper operated.

Instead of faxing in stories they were e-mailed, along with any accompanying photos. Instead of spending time re-keying stories, staff were easily able to copy and paste, then emailed off to editors for further review.


Eventually the layouts could be previewed digitally by local staff prior to publication, but that didn’t prevent mistakes from happening from time to time. The Northern Pen, a sister paper, once won a Red Lobster award for making a huge blooper.


“They were changing their masthead,” chuckles Blackmore. “It all got printed and nobody noticed anything, but when it all went through and we got the papers, it was the Northern Penis!”


Blackmore believes the error was likely a sort of autocorrect mistake, and the award provided many a chuckle over the years. As the paper evolved, so did Blackmore’s role.


She did much more than just type up stories, serve customers and organize paper carriers. For a while she dabbled in sales before deciding it wasn’t for her, but she did enjoy editing and helping with the layout.


The thing she will miss most of all is the people. Blackmore credits her colleagues over the years for teaching her so much about the newspaper business.


“The interaction, all of the interaction with them and knowing what was going on in the town. I loved my job. I absolutely loved my job.”",

  body: "This is the tale of a young woman’s trek from her home in the city where she attends university, to her childhood home four hours away to deal with the situation of clearing out the home that she grew up in and to get her mother ready for a placement in a care home. A story of secrets, lies and mystery abound.


Set on the rugged coast of Newfoundland, where the weather can change from nice to nasty with the snap of your fingers.


Hannah Fitzgerald cannot believe the state of her childhood home and is totally unaware of how nasty and dangerous her mother, Adelaide, can be due to her dementia. Adelaide is not going to be leaving peacefully, oh no she is not! 


Hannah, with the help of her mother’s nurse, Colleen, is determined to see it through until the end. Hannah uncovers a secret room in the attic and learns of her mother’s friend from long ago, Ada Fraser. Things are not as they seem. 


The Woman In The Attic is a psychological thriller that takes you on a ride of unexpected events that lead to an ending you would never imagine. Spine tingling.


The characters in the story are interesting, Hannah appears to be a confident young woman who begins to doubt herself. Her mother, Adelaide, is stronger than she appears, and there are things that she says and things that she does that are surprising and startling to Hannah. Colleen the nurse appears cool and aloof and it appears in all ways that she is just there for the job and nothing else. But is she? There is more to her than meets the eye in a very unnerving kind of way. 


The story is slow going at first and doesn’t really take off until about midway through. From there to the end it keeps your attention on it’s winding trail that gives you chills down your spine. The character’s all appear disconnected until in the latter part of the story where you can finally see how the puzzle is fitting together and this makes up for the slow beginning. 


The characters are well developed with surprises popping out at you along the way. You think you have it all figured out but lo and behold, the author takes you along a narrow, twisting path that makes you hold your breath. The surprises brings the reader to tears and anger. A suspenseful read from a young author who has talent. 


I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes psychological thrillers, it will send chills down your spine. 


Final rating: 4 out of 5 stars (for some spelling errors).",

  subtitles: "Wayne Osmond successfully grows his own vegetables in a challenging climate without using pesticides or fertilizers. – © Rosalyn Roy",
  body: "ROSE BLANCHE - HARBOUR LE COU – Not every town or outport has a community garden, but that hasn’t stopped residents of the Southwest Coast from picking up a shovel and planting their own crops. Growing vegetables might be becoming a more popular hobby, but it can be trickier along the coast, which doesn’t always enjoy the benefits of the Codroy Valley’s micro-climate.


For Wayne and Edith Osmond at least, fog, wind and rain don’t seem to be proving much of a hinderance. The Osmonds have plenty of potatoes stored for the winter, and carrots so large that a single one is enough for them both to have a meal.


“You save money on potatoes and carrots and stuff like that,” says Wayne. “I don’t know how much we save now, but we eat 200 pounds of potatoes every year. That’s what I got every year to keep us going from one season to the next season.”


Wayne says Edith bought a 10 pound bag of potatoes because she couldn’t find any in the basement.


“I said there’s no potatoes in the basement but there’s lots down in the garden.”


They also grow beets, turnips and, hunkered behind some plastic in a makeshift tabletop greenhouse, cabbages sprouting thick, vibrant leaves. He expects to leave those in for another month or so.


The vegetables he’s growing behind his house are mostly in small individual tubs, including 5-gallon buckets. Atop a large rock, Wayne has laid out thick plastic fish tubs laid out to grow his beets. He will plant in every kind of container he can get his hands on and swears that vegetables will grow in pretty much anything.


“Last year I threw in some potato skins, some peels and that,” says Wayne, waving a hand at a battered grey tub filled with flourishing green stalks. “I had this for compost. And this year look what grew up there.”


He doesn’t plan to pick the carrots still growing in some of the buckets. Instead he’ll shove it all into the crawl space under his house as is. In the winter or even in the spring when he needs a carrot for his dinner he can just pop into the basement and grab one.


Because the weather apparently isn’t enough of a challenge, the Osmonds also choose to grow their own food without the aid of pesticides.


“I use salt water to spray my turnip and cabbage with,” says Wayne, who has a cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternative to deal with unwanted bugs in his garden instead. “Get yourself a spray bottle full of salt water out of the ocean. When we get a couple of dry days i go out at night before dark and lift up the leaves and spray a bit of salt water over them and that takes care of them. You can’t do it too often. You can’t do it every day, but every couple of weeks or so you can spray it with salt water and that helps to keep the bugs off the leaves. They don’t like salt.”


To combat slugs he advises chopping a plastic soda bottle in half, filling one half with beer and planting it deep in the soil. After a day or two it will be full of slugs.


When it comes to fertilizer, he prefers to use kelp. It’s free, easy to source, all natural and highly effective. He’ll pop down to the beach and grab some off the rocks, then chop it up into mulch and mix it into the soil prior to planting. He likes to plant around mid-June.


Most of their crop isn’t planted this close to the house though. A few years ago, the couple bought a crumbling house on an adjacent street for $2,000 and tore it down. Wayne repurposed the salvaged wood and other materials to build himself a large garage, then built eight raised gardening beds on the rest of the land for a large garden where he grows most of the vegetables, including the different varieties potatoes such as red skin potatoes or Yukon gold.


“There are not too many places you can plant anything,” says Wayne, leading the way down to the garage.


Dominating the garden are large commercial fish tubs. Wayne saws them in half, fills them with soil and wishes he had more of those instead of the wooden raised beds. He’s also bolted together some of the commercial tub lids to make still more beds.


“Things grow in that way better,” says Wayne. “Once these get hot they stay hot. Night time it doesn’t cool down so it’s got warm soil all the time.”


He got the commercial tubs from the old fish plant. They were already damaged significantly, so repurposing them makes for a better garden crop while keeping plastics out of the landfill. Even as he wishes for more, Wayne says he has to stop adding on to the garden.


“Right now I’m growing a lot of stuff and giving it away,” says Wayne, who actually doesn’t mind sharing with his family and friends. “My daughter lives in Codroy Valley and I send her up beets and carrots. They’ve got a garden too, but they’re mostly into strawberries, tomatoes, broccoli.”


The couple also grow a variety of bright, colourful flowers around their home. Two small wooden wheelbarrows on their bridge, not far from their door, are still producing buttercrunch lettuce a full week into October. Edith swears it’s better than the romaine they also grow.


“You’re used to working all your life. When you retire you gotta have something to do to pass the time,” says Wayne. “The satisfaction of seeing it grow, and when you harvest it, that’s the best part of all.”",

Taurus

You're wanting to get better organized and work efficiently. However, very likely, you will be quiet about it even though you feel quietly anxious within you. Try to let this go. You don't need this added stress.


Gemini

Expect a few surprises but not good ones. This could be a power struggle with a friend or a group. Don't make a big deal about this! Get work done instead of play.


Cancer

Happy at home with family. You might interact with a parent more than usual. Be vigilant with kids midweek to avoid an accident. Keep your eyes peeled. Things could get nasty so don't push your luck. A trip is on the way. 


Leo

Busy time! You have a full agenda and you're wanting help. Reach out to friends and support systems. Focus on mental stimulation. You can do it.


Virgo 

Money is on your mind right now. This is great week to buy clothes. Be careful because something unusual and unexpected might occur. Accidents happen. 


Libra 

You attract people and favourable situations to you. Something unusual might affect your earnings or your possessions. Focus on patience.


Scorpio 

Your birthday will soon arrive. You might encounter someone you least expect to see, especially from your past. Focus on health. 


Sagittarius

This is a good week to think about your goals and how you can make some of your dreams come true. Things aren't turning out the way you thought. You might have to regroup. Avoid some kind of ego battle with your kids or with a romantic partner.


Capricorn 

Ask for what you want. Timing is everything. A friend or a member of a group might do something that surprises you. (This could be interesting.) However, be careful because power struggles at home or with a family member are likely.


Aquarius

Something unexpected related to parents, bosses or authority figures will catch you off guard. Be careful driving. This energy can engage others in a negative way. Focus on practice and life skills. 


Pisces

This continues to be a pretty intense week for you. However, at the same time, unexpected travel plans or a surprise related to politics, religion or racial issues might catch you off guard. Focus on fun.",

  subtitles: "",
  body: "It seems to be everywhere you look these days – tucked up against buildings or sidewalks, tangled in foliage, drifting across roads. Port aux Basques has a litter problem and it seems to be getting worse, despite increased attention on local social media.


Heavy rains can be mistaken for help if it washes some away, usually down into the harbour and out to sea. The Sea Turtle Conservancy (conserveturtles.org) estimates that 1 million marine animals, including sharks, whales, fish, turtles and birds, are killed every year by plastic that ends up in the ocean.


There are even public trash bins around town to help alleviate the problem, some in areas that consistently seem to have large amounts of litter. One such area is Hopedale Avenue near the new municipal depot. The brightly coloured trash can doesn’t spoil the view, but all along the street and especially where it ends at a circular turnaround, there are used food containers, Tim Horton’s cups and cigarette butts blowing around in the wind.


“Near the new municipal garage litter is horrible despite efforts to keep it clean,” agreed Mayor John Spencer via e-mail. “Hopefully the camera system will deter (littering) once in place.”


Even with a camera system in place, however, litter bylaws are not among those the Channel-Port aux Basques detachment of the RCMP usually enforces. Cpl. Colin Helm says that unless someone witnesses a littering incident or even illegal dumping and reports it, or if a member of the detachment observes it while on patrol, there’s not much the RCMP can do to help.


“That is always the Catch 22,” writes Spencer. “Why have a bylaw if there is no enforcement?”


The RCMP does help enforce some of the town bylaws, usually those related to speeding or noise complaints during quiet hours. Spencer says the detachment is excellent when it comes to helping out with snow clearing violations.


“It is similar with roaming animals. The Town does have a part time enforcement officer. However, in relation to litter or failure to pick up after a pet it gets a little trickier,” admits Spencer.


Part of the problem may stem from the new tipping fees. Before the new provincial waste management plan was put in place, a trip to the dump to drop off extra garbage or larger items was free. Now it can cost money and, even if the charge is relatively small, some residents seem inclined to avoid it. That only serves to further compound the town’s problem because all of this litter is helping to attract rats.


“You will notice Town removed the litter box from Scott’s Cove,” noted Spencer in his letter. “Issue of rodents feeding on indiscriminate dumping.”


Removing the garbage box might have stopped the dumping but it has hardly helped serve the area’s overall attractiveness. Scott’s Cove, with its brightly painted kiosks and scenic boardwalk, now has an increase in litter that gets trapped along the path before settling into the rocks below or ending up in the harbour.


The Town Council and Public Works are currently researching ways to help combat the increased number of rats, and part of that will have to include cutting off the food supply. But even if upgraded trash cans, such as the heavy plastic ones used by larger municipalities like St. John’s are installed, it seems unlikely to help combat the rat problem if people continue to litter.


Writes Spencer, “(There is) No magic formula except try to do our best to get individuals to change behaviour.”",

We had a weekend schedule arranged to ensure all groups got a chance to touch the ice, get back at it and get a feel for what the new norm will be. Our regular weekly schedule is still being fine-tuned and will be posted on our Facebook page for our members and participants once finalized.

 

Just as the reintegration into public places was ever-evolving this summer, this too will be an ever-evolving process. Those who are members of our Minor Hockey Association can be kept apprised of the need to know facts and details on our face book page.




We look forward to continued support and collaboration with HNL, The Bruce II Arena and the Town of CPAB to provide, though a different season, an enjoyable one to the children. Seeing the smiles on the kids’ faces, and hearing the laughter and squeals of excitement made the past few months of planning all worth it. They truly are resilient human beings, that have been tossed a ton of new expectations and are handling it like the true champs they are.  

 

Organizing return to play encompassed many different Covid guidelines that can be found on the Government of NL website (https://www.gov.nl.ca/covid-19/), some of which were: Government of NL COVID-19 Resources, Government of NL Sport Guidance, Government of NL Arena Operations Guidance, Hockey Canada Return to Hockey Resources, Hockey NL-COVID-19 Resources – Use of Masks.

 

We were able to keep our registration costs the same, our ticket selling demand the same and our program was able to retain healthy participation numbers across nine full time divisions, despite the regulations the pandemic has imposed on us. We have a great network of on ice and off ice officials, coaching and training staff and parent volunteers helping us captain this ship. It truly does take a village and Port aux Basques has answered the call tenfold.",

  body: "After nearly 100 years of facing the wrath of Port aux Basques weather, the St. James Anglican Church is beginning to show its age. 


According to Rev. Jane Allen, the present church was erected in 1927, thanks in large part to the fishermen of the time.


“They would bring fish in, and that would be their donation towards helping the church. They would sell that day’s catch, and if they didn't catch anything or couldn't go out due to the weather, then they would help to build the church itself.”


Rev. Allen goes on to say that construction on the current church began in 1925, with its first divine service held in June of 1927. 


With time and weather being a constant for the building, Rev. Allen has just overseen the second year of a three-year effort to bring the church back to its youth. 


The towers of the church, at a height of 65 feet, present a large portion of the expenses towards maintenance and restoration. Allen states they have already spent approximately $65,000 on repairs and have done about half of the building. 


“The side towards East Haven funeral home is done, the side with the stained glass window is done, and we got one of the towers done.”


Allen hopes to have the job completed next year, emphasizing the importance of the building.


“Its a landmark. Our church is a landmark. You can see it whichever way you come. My father used to use it as a marker when he was out fishing!”


While the inside remains in excellent condition, the wind and salt air have taken its toll on the exterior. 


“Hopefully we can get the old shingles off next year, and get it all insulated, with new siding on next year.”


One hundred percent of the money for the work on St. James has come from donations and estate bequeathments. The church has received donations from as far away as Ontario, as well as via electronic money transfers.Allen says the towers alone have an estimated cost of over $30,000 worth of work, with the north tower having had the shingles and rotten wood both replaced and new siding put on. 


Those who have been inside the old church are frequently amazed at the beauty and style inside, which fortunately needs very little work aside from a new carpet. Allen says the current carpet is fairly well worn. 


“This is basically a complete overhaul of the church, and after this is done, she should be good for another 50 or 60 years,” chuckles the reverend.


The large stained glass window, which was dedicated in 1960, has not escaped the rigours of weather either. 


“This year when we took the siding off, we found that there wasn't a lot of caulking compound and around the panels themselves, the solder, that all had to be replaced this year. So the window should be able to withstand a few more storms.”


Repair of the stained glass over the years is a frequent issue, as Allen says they had a glass window fund for the multiple panes, having had new windows come in back in 2017 at a cost of around $43,000. 


“Whatever has got to be done is going to be done,” says Rev Allen firmly. “I’d sort of like to get it airtight, wind tight and watertight before we do anything inside.” 


A monument for Rev. LeGallais, who served as rector of the church from 1857-1869 and who drowned while serving in that capacity, still stands next to the church driveway.


Says Allen, “There’s so much history in this building. We have to do out best to preserve it.”",

  subtitles: "Haley Parsons is the artist behind 'Drowned Childhood' which seeks to draw attention to underage alcohol consumption. - © Rosalyn Roy",
  body: "ROSE BLANCHE - HARBOUR LE COU – On a concrete pad inside the playground fence sits an unlikely collection of beer bottles, crayons, toys and even a tire swing. Conceived as part of a college assignment by artist Haley Parsons, the second-year Grenfell student is hoping to provoke some thought and perhaps even discussion about the realities of underage drinking.


“I’m doing a sculpture class online and this is an interjection project,” says Parsons, who received support from town council for her project’s location. “This piece I would like to call Drowned Childhood.”


The piece is supposed to represent alcoholism, particularly underage alcoholism.


“It’s a problem here in Newfoundland among the youth,” says Parsons. “I personally think it’s a bit of a problem. I have been affected by it before.”


Parents who keep beer in the house may not readily notice when a bottle goes missing. Easy access to alcohol combined with some peer pressure can cause problems for young teens or even pre-teens, something which Parsons witnessed firsthand back when she was only fourteen.


“I don’t think it brings any sort of joy. I don’t think it’s needed in order to make friends with people, and it causes a lot of problems when you grow up. It affects your ability to learn. It can affect your lifestyle. It can affect your social life. It can affect a lot of things, and I feel like that isn’t spoken out against strongly enough here,” says Parsons. “We grow up around it. We’re accustomed to it, so at a young age we think it’s okay.”


As much as she might wish it, she doesn’t expect her art project to spearhead any kind of grand and sweeping change. Instead the desire is to get people’s attention, and like most artists Parsons is adept at using her talent and training whenever she can to draw attention to the issues that matter to her.


“I don’t think I can completely change everything,” she admits. “I may at least change a few lives. That’s why I wanted to put it on the playground, right? Because parents will come in here with their children and they’ll play, and while they’re playing they’ll have this sitting right here.”


Already she says a few have taken notice even when just strolling by the area. She hopes it will get parents wondering about what their children might be experiencing or provoke them to talk to their children about alcohol while they are still relatively young.


“There are parents who are like, ‘No. You shouldn’t be doing this’ and being really strict about it, but kids always find a way,” says Parsons. “I think it’s really a learning curve for both parent and child.”


Parsons has been an artist from a young age and hopes to develop it as a career. In addition to sculpting, she also enjoys painting and writing. In the future, if she has more opportunities to put up further exhibits to draw attention to other issues, she will certainly take advantage.


“Maybe speak a little bit more about mental health. I think that would be a pretty good topic to talk about. There are a few other ones – environment probably as well,” says Parsons.


Not all of her work revolves around causes though. She has pieces she creates just for her own enjoyment too. For now she is continuing to focus on her studies, which can present problems when learning remotely. She says she sometimes finds it difficult to do art online, and would rather be in a classroom setting where she could gain hands on experience with different tools, for example.


But there’s also some upside to remote learning. Sometimes she just enjoys relaxing at home with her parents.


“I have a lot more free time on my hands as well to do stuff like this.”",

  subtitles: "Doreen and Jim MacDougall with their dog, Star.",
  body: "Like his famous father, Lauchie, Jim MacDougall is pretty good at predicting the weather, or at least when a storm is brewing. It stands to reason. Jim grew up in the Wreckhouse too.


“I was about 18 when I left there I guess,” recalls Jim. “I went to work when I was 14. Working on the highways, construction work. I lied and said I was 17.”


It took him two years to get on the pay roll so he could declare income tax.


“You wouldn’t get away with that now,” says a soft-spoken Jim. 


The third youngest child of Lauchie and Emily MacDougall, Jim remembers clapping his hands over his ears and feeling scared when the wind was roaring through, down from the mountains and over the iconic green family homestead. He says the worst kind of wind was when it would die out and then suddenly snap back.


His father was born in 1898 and died in 1965. Lauchie fought a hard battle against stomach cancer before he went.


“Back then we didn’t know much here about stuff like that,” says Jim.


At times his father’s pain was so great that Jim couldn’t bear to listen to it and would have to leave the house. In the end, Jim remembers that his father ‘came back to himself’ and passed away at home peacefully. His wife, Emily (née Moore), passed in 1992 at age 81.


The MacDougalls had 12 children, and Jim says six of his siblings are left. The family has suffered its share of tragedies. Jim’s youngest brother died at 21, killed by a crusher. Another died of cancer at only 27. But there were triumphs also. Another who contracted polio in childhood wasn’t supposed to make it past age 5. He lived into his 70s.


Jim jokes that the house had cupboards to fit all the children into before revealing that it actually had 11 bedrooms.


“They had a hallway. They had beds on both sides. That house was big – it only looked small in pictures,” says Jim.


The youngest of the children would double up in the bedrooms, and with so many children there was enough of an age gap that the older ones were on the cusp of moving out or had already done so while Jim was still a wee lad.


Jim’s wife, Doreen (née Peyton), says that the MacDougalls were always rescuing motorists after they got blown off at the Wreckhouse.


“They used to take in people stranded on the highway almost every night in the winter,” she says. “People they didn’t even know and they were lifelong friends after that.”


The MacDougall’s house itself never surrendered to the raging winds. Beneath the green painted shakes and felt waterproofing were heavy logs and thick beams. Lauchie had been born at the Wreckhouse and knew how to build something that would stand solid and firm. It was burned down some time around 1994.


“Before they had a house there, my grandparents used to have a house out across the railway tracks,” remembers Jim.


The MacDougalls kept animals and grew their own vegetables. There wasn’t much other choice back then. They’d churn their own butter and salt that too, along with the meat that would see them through the winter.


There were hens and pigs and sheep and cattle to care for, and in the winter they were kept inside. Then there was Lauchie’s pet moose. Jim has a photo of that moose, not yet a yearling, with its head turned from the camera. His brothers, Ches and Kevin, are in the photo next to the moose, a black and white print with all three next standing against the green house.


Jim remembers that the moose didn’t like the wind but doesn’t remember what the family had named it.


“They had a name on him though,” says Jim. “When the wind would get from the southeast to northeast, the change in wind would make him crazy. We had to put him in. We had him all one summer. He went into the park in St. John’s.”


His brother, Vince, keeps a cabin down around there now, where Jim likes to spend a lot of his time. He still loves the Wreckhouse.


“He wanted to go down there to live when we were rearing our children,” chuckles Doreen. “He was at it for years, and he was at it before the kids even went to school.”


The couple’s home is filled with artwork, photos and paintings of the Wreckhouse. One shows the train toppling over and another shows Emily out on the line, hanging clothes while Lauchie and one of his boys are on the other side of the house examining the mist rolling down from the mountains.


Eventually they settled in O’Regan’s where they currently spoil their small dog, Star. Doreen insists that Jim would still move back to the Wreckhouse if she agreed.


“If I said let’s go tomorrow we’d be gone,” says Doreen. “He wants to go down there to die he says.”


Jim retired when he was just 55. During the hunting season he will go get his moose and help his buddies haul out theirs. He and Doreen also keep a vegetable garden with staples like beets, carrots and potatoes. To keep busy Doreen likes to sew. She worked in homecare for over 30 years, and in addition to their own two boys the couple fostered.


“Thirty years and I had fifty-three children,” says Doreen.


These days there are grandchildren to fuss over, although spoiling them is made more difficult because of COVID-19. Thankfully there is Facetime at night to help keep in touch, but it’s just not the same as sitting around for Sunday dinners. Like all families, the couple look forward to a time when they can all get together once more for hugs and kisses.


In the meantime, Jim will keep answering the phone every time it rings, which is apparently quite often. Doreen says it doesn’t stop from the first of the season right up until the last day.


“There’s always somebody calling me to go moose hunting,” says Jim.",

  body: "Keeping

Alexander John Keeping pleaded guilty to dangerous operation of a conveyance (CCC 2018 [320.13-1) and possessing a controlled drug or substance (CDS 1996 [4-1]). Judge Cole is expected to hand down sentencing on Dec. 3, pending a pre-sentence report.


Munden

Damien Munden, who chose to represent himself, pleaded guilty to a single count of operation of a conveyance while impaired .08 or over (CCC 2018 [320.14-1-b]). Crown attorney Lori St. Croix withdrew a second charge and the matter proceeded immediately to sentencing.


Under the statement of agreed facts, Munden admitted that on May 21, 2020 he was driving a vehicle for which he was not registered or insured, which rolled across a lawn and broke a water main before rolling onto the road. Munden subsequently drove off with a female passenger.


Witnesses then notified the Port aux Basques detachment of the RCMP, and a traffic stop was made on Route 470 not far from Isle aux Morts, shortly after 4 p.m. The police report stated that the vehicle had been observed swerving well across the yellow centre line, almost striking the opposite shoulder, before returning to its own lane.


After identifying the driver as Damien Munden, the RCMP officer noted signs of impairment such as slurred speech, confusion and an odour of liquour. Munden was subsequently arrested and transported to the RCMP station where, shortly before 6 pm, a breathalyzer test found 270 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of his blood.


Calling the high blood alcohol reading ‘aggravating’, the Crown requested a fine of $3,000 and a two year driving prohibition, but observed that Munden had no criminal record and was taking responsibility for his actions.


After stating that a 30 percent victim surcharge would also be applied, Judge Cole reduced the fine to $2,500 and gave Munden one year to pay $3,250 in total. However, Cole did impose the recommended driving prohibition for a two-year period.


“You’re so lucky that you didn’t kill somebody here,” said Cole. “You’re so lucky that you are here facing a driving prohibition and fines as opposed to jail.”",

  body: "Welcome back! Although Thanksgiving has passed, it is still the fall season and what goes better with that than pumpkin pie?


 When we think of Thanksgiving, often times the first things that pops into our minds are turkey, family, and pumpkin pie. I strive to put a unique touch on traditional favourites, so this month I have a different spin on a classic dessert you might to try. This is a Pumpkin Crisp (Zucca Croccante), which spices things up a bit as opposed to a traditional pumpkin pie. 


When it comes to the pumpkin pureé, you can used a canned filling, but for the best results you’ll want to roast your own pumpkins. All you’ll need is 6 mini pumpkins and a pinch of salt.


Pumpkin pureé:

Start by cutting the pumpkins in half. Be careful with that knife because the skins are very tough! Scrape out the seeds and put a pinch of salt in each half. Lay the pumpkin halves skin side down on a parchment-lined pan and bake on 400 for approximately one hour or until the filling is very tender. Let cool until you can handle them, and then with a spoon, scrape out the filling. Place the filling in a food processor and pureé until smooth, then refrigerate. There you have it – your own pumpkin pureé!


Ingredients:

3 eggs

1 cup sugar

15 oz pumpkin purée

2/3 cup heavy cream

2 tsp pumpkin pie spice

1 tsp vanilla

½ tsp kosher salt


Crumb topping:

1 ½ cup flour

1 ½ cup brown sugar

Pinch of kosher salt

¾ cup butter

Ice cream or whipped cream for garnish

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spray a 9 by 13-inch pan with cooking spray and set aside.

Whisk eggs and sugar until they are completely blended. Add the pureé, cream, vanilla, pumpkin pie spice and salt. Whisk mixture until smooth and blended.


In another bowl, combine the dry ingredients and then add butter. Mix by hand to incorporate the butter until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Add a small amount of the crumb mixture to bottom of greased pan and pat together. Then pour pureé mix into the dish and sprinkle the rest of the crumbs over the top evenly.


Bake until set and golden brown, approximately 45-50 minutes. Serve topped with whipped cream or ice cream. Enjoy!",

  body: "MARGAREE-FOX ROOST – The stormy weather wreaked a little bit of havoc in Margaree over the Thanksgiving weekend. 


During the Saturday night Oct. 10 storm, winds peaked well over 100 kilometres per hour and caused a loss of power to the pumphouse that supplies water to the residents of Margaree-Fox Roost. 


Two electrical poles were snapped off by the turbulent weather, knocking out power to the pumphouse entirely. 


Dwayne Vautier, Chair of the Local Service District, stated via telephone interview that they didn't even know there was a problem until the reservoir had been fully depleted. 


“It was late Saturday night before we realized it, once we were out of water, and we went up and turned on the diesel motor pump. So it wasn't very long that people were out of water,” said Vautier.


He estimates contractor crews were busy repairing and replacing the poles from Sunday morning into that evening, and full service has now been restored. 


According to Vautier, Margaree-Fox Roost has been slated for pole replacement for the last three years but, “They haven't gotten to it yet. Two years ago we had a pole break and catch fire, but the rest are all really old.”",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Getting the Bruce II back to business while still remaining compliant with provincial COVID-19 measures remains a work in progress, says manager Wanda Ryan Merrigan. In addition to the facility’s own protocols, each group has its own procedures to follow to keep participants safe. That currently means abiding by no less than nine different sets of regulations.


The two biggest groups are minor hockey and the figure skating club. While younger children can be accompanied by a parent or caregiver, children who are nine years old or over must enter alone and ready to go.


“A child nine or over should be able to tie their own skates. Are there children who may need an extra tightening? Absolutely. Coaches are prepared to tie skates,” offers Merrigan.


A recent post on social media expressed the frustration some parents are facing. Merrigan is sympathetic that parents are frustrated at not being able to watch their children play but says that the restrictions, while inconvenient, are absolutely necessary.


“We’re in a global pandemic so we’re doing the best we can to decrease the risk of transmission and to ensure that, if we ever have a case here, we don’t have 300 people to contact trace, we’re only going to have 100,” says Merrigan. “We have one common area downstairs, so anybody who comes in and out of our building goes through the common area. So what we’ve tried to do is try to factor in people, place, time and space.”


Ideally the Bruce II tries to restrict occupants to a maximum number of 100 people at any given time. It’s not always feasible.


“We had about 50 skaters, 10 coaches and helpers,” says Merrigan about a recent skate. “There were 31 parents in the stands. So between the rink and the benches we had 91 people. We also have a fitness centre, a bowling alley, a swimming pool that are equally as important.”


The main door is the only entry point, and the pool door serves as the only exit to keep foot traffic flowing in one direction. Parents of younger children are obliged to sit in designated bleacher seats that are taped off to comply with the six foot distancing rule.


Merrigan says many hours have been put into just figuring out what will work and what won’t. There have been tweaks, of course, as the rules are put into practice. And of course there’s a lot of extra cleaning but no extra staff to do it.


“I’ve got Tony (Tulk) just about drove crazy,” admits Merrigan. “He’s our maintenance guy here. Tony and I have measured and re-measured and measured again. We’ve walked the dressing rooms. We’ve looked at whether we can reconfigure stuff, but you can’t change the shape of your building.”


Merrigan hopes that by November she’ll be able to ease restrictions, but if a second wave does hit they may actually have to be tightened. In the meantime she asks for patience and understanding.


“We’re doing the very best that we can.”",

  body: "CAPE RAY – It seems like Paul Taverner has played music with everyone along the Southwest coast of Newfoundland. Photos of his former bandmates – and he’s been in over a dozen bands – line the walls of the studio basement in the home he shares with his wife, Ivy and their rescue cat, Wyatt.


As a member of Souls he’s played with Harold Crewe, Jerome Pearce, Max Piercey and Clayton Pierce. He’s played with Lorne Pierce, Don Crew, Dave Osmond, Albert Osmond, Bruce LeRiche, Lloyd Strickland, Junior Bragg, Ray Spencer and Wallace Gale. As a member of the Gateway Group he played with Christine Buffett right up until she passed away.


Paul remembers everyone fondly, praising each musician in turn. He’s a bass guitarist himself, but he can play some jigs and waltzes on one of his accordions, and long ago he used to play the drums, but bass is his favourite instrument.


Paul has been playing music since 1967. His brother, David, was a drummer up until he passed about three years ago. One of his other brothers, Lloyd, also likes to play music.


“My Dad was a good singer but he couldn’t play any instruments,” remembers Paul.

Most of the Souls band members weren’t yet old enough to drink when they began performing at clubs and other establishments. In fact, three of them were still in high school.


“If we wanted to play the Legion, we had to get a written file from the RCMP to play in there,” says Paul. “The only one who was old enough was Jerome. He was a bit older.”


One club he played in was called the Wreckhouse. It used to be located in the Grand Bay Mall, but it only lasted a couple of years before too much competition and high overhead forced it to close.


“Gary Thompson was the manager there. He used to be manager of the Port Club,” says Paul. “We were the house band so when the club hired other bands we played elsewhere.”


Paul remembers that time fondly, jamming with other bands that rolled through from other parts of the island or mainland Nova Scotia and Ontario. After the Wreckhouse closed, the musicians went their separate ways, came back together in other bands and moved around again.


“The Wreckhouse band was truly a popular and very tight band,” says Paul, who calls Clayton Pierce one of the best singers in the region. “We mostly played rock and a bit of country.”


Paul is especially partial to the Beatles, but covers included the Rolling Stones, the Dave Clark Five, the Eagles and the Hollies. Then there’s the Newfoundland music, of course.

Just learning the songs back then was time consuming. There were no smart phones or internet to research.


“We had to listen to a tape recorder. We had to write off the words. A lot of times you couldn’t understand what they were saying,” laughs Paul. “We had to figure out the chords ourselves.”


They spent a considerable amount of time with the tape recorder, but that worked well enough to impress Jim Crewe of the Ducats who wandered in to tell them they sounded just like The Hollies. He had been downstairs having a beer during one of the band’s rehearsals.


“We put a band together for the Cape Ray Come Home Year. That was in 2007. We were called the Cape Ray Sandhoppers,” grins Paul. “They used to call us sandhoppers one time up here. In Port aux Basques, when you went to school, that’s what they’d call us – sandhoppers. It’s a little shrimp-like thing that hops on the beach.”


At one point Paul and his bandmates were invited to Toronto to play in the Caribou Club where Harry Hibbs used to play, but they still had two band members in high school and the other three were working. They kept playing around the region, and sometimes a bit beyond.


They met more high profile entertainers, including April Wine in Halifax, and were going to get together with them, but the famous band had to move on before they could meet up. They turned down bookings for St. John’s too, but they did manage to play in Corner Brook and Stephenville.


“I’m surprised my wife stayed with me cause I was out all hours. You didn’t get home until three or four o’clock, and I had to get up the next morning to go to work.”


Like most entertainers, Paul misses playing in front of a live audience full of his fans. These days Paul plays for St. James the Evangelist. He’ll play at other churches too and before COVID-19 he would appear at Shark Cove. He and Lloyd recently shot a video with their friend, Wayne Osmond, which actually came as a bit of a surprise.


“I didn’t know it was on there (YouTube) until somebody told me,” he shrugs. Perhaps they’ll shoot more videos, as time and opportunity permit. “This COVID came up and fooled us all up.”",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Councillor Melvin Keeping was the only member of council absent from the latest meeting of Town Council on Tuesday, Oct. 13.


Cost recovery

Mayor John Spencer has drafted another presentation related to cost recovery which he hopes to host locally before sending it to Newfoundland Members of Parliament and provincial leaders. In the meantime he has sent it to all members of council for review.


Economic development

Town clerk Julia Ingram delivered the latest report as Economic Development Strategist Shauna Strickland was unavailable.

The town’s bid to provide a cold storage facility for vegetables and other produce was turned down. The site of the facility will be in Robinson’s, closer to the producers and harvesters. Town Manager Leon MacIsaac believes the new facility may be located along the TransCanada Highway where the old Midway Motel used to be.

A grant was secured to hire four workers for a total of 14 weeks to complete repair work on the Grand Bay West Trail. A new section is also expected to be put in place leading from the end of Hopedale Avenue down to the existing trail.


Come Home Year

It seems unlikely that postponed Come Home Year 2020 will still go ahead in 2021 given the COVID-19 restrictions prohibiting large scale gatherings which are typical throughout that week, especially when it comes to musical performances.

“Unless something drastically changes, I mean now they’re into a second wave,” noted Coun. Jim Lane. “The other thing is, if you come home for Come Home Year, you’ve got to isolate for two weeks. There’s no point. It doesn’t look good at this point in time.”

However, no official cancellation has yet been announced.


Farmer’s Market

Vendors selling food and other items from their vehicles will be required to do so in the parking lot of the Railway Heritage Museum. The town is hoping that by establishing a farmer’s market in that location it will be safer for buyers and sellers, as well as alleviate traffic congestion near the hospital.


Beach overnight parking

The information package submitted to council by a resident of Kyle Lane objecting to overnight campers on the beach parking lot was discussed. Both Mayor Spencer and Coun. Lane noted that the photos included were actually of the C.N. parking lot and not that of the beach parking lot.

Deputy Mayor Todd Strickland noted that the signatures on the submitted petition included those of residents living nowhere near Kyle Lane or the beach area.

“I remember that issue very well back in the ‘90s when I was on council,” said Spencer. “It was a private property in the Codroy Valley that registered a complaint at that time.”

He told council that before the larger ferries were able to accommodate more campers, tourists used to park near the former ASIL industrial building when they rolled into town the evening before the next morning crossing. Spencer recalled that Mayor Aneitha Sheaves was put in a difficult position, as she didn’t want the town to appear unwelcoming to tourists and drive away potential revenue. For his part, Coun. Lane agreed that the town should be pushing Hopedale as an alternative rest spot as opposed to the beach parking lot, but no official motion was made to post signage to prohibit any further overnight parking at Grand Bay West.


Power update

Newfoundland Hydro intends to place electric car charging stations near the Irving’s Mainway Gas Station. No timeline for the installation was given but currently the only place in town to charge an electric vehicle is located at St. Christopher’s Hotel. Meanwhile Newfoundland Power has advised that the dedicated line to the Lion’s Club, which serves as an emergency warming centre during prolonged outages, is completed and just needs to be charged.


Fire department

The Channel-Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department is still trying to figure out if it can hold a Christmas parade during a global pandemic. If they are able to figure out a solution to proceed with a parade, it will likely be very different from previous years.

Meanwhile the new pumper truck is slightly behind schedule and not expected to be delivered before mid-November. After the truck arrives it will need to have decals put on.


Grand Bay Bottom Sewer Project begins

Three tenders for the Grand Bay Bottom Sewer Project were submitted. The lowest tender for $1,035,042.55, which was the only one within the allotted budget, was the successful bid adopted by council. Work on the project has already begun.",

  body: "SOUTHWEST COAST – More than $340,000 in funding designed to enhance user experience and boost tourism was announced by the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA) on Thursday, Oct. 15. The project is a joint effort by ACOA and five other Regional Development Agencies, along with the federal and provincial governments.


Through ACOA, the Government of Canada is providing a non-repayable contribution of $211,399 through its Innovative Communities Fund. The provincial government is chipping in with $134,375 for the first phase of the project and Trans Canada Trail is contributing $150,000.


“Investing in tourism infrastructure is essential to building healthy communities and growing a strong, sustainable rural economy. We recognize the significant impact COVID-19 has had on tourism and that is why we are investing in important projects to strengthen key assets like the Newfoundland T’Railway. Initiatives like this one will help Newfoundland and Labrador’s tourism sector come back even stronger than before,” stated Gudie Hutchings, Member of Parliament for Long Range Mountains via the news release.


Much needed repairs to the Newfoundland T’Railways Provincial Park bridges have already taken place, according to Jamie Warren, the Executive Director of the Newfoundland T’Railway Council. The Bear Cove Brook bridge and another east of St. Andrews have been completed, and MacDougall’s Gulch has also been fixed.


“St. Andrew’s is next on our list. Just waiting for lumber and then we’re off to the Stephenville area,” said Warren via phone interview on Tuesday, Oct. 6. “It’s just a matter of getting material.”


The good weather of late has helped the contractors make excellent progress. Photos have been posted to social media about the work, but the government has held off releasing updates thus far.


“Within government circles sometimes things get delayed and get rearranged in terms of press releases and communications and all that jazz,” said Warren. “You can’t hold up the project so we are working through it. And of course everything’s different with COVID.” 

Lorne Seaward is the superintendent overseeing the repairs to the T’Railway in this region. He says that in addition to fixing the decking, the support and other work, the contractor will also be clearing the brush from the sides of the trail all the way in as far as Stephenville.


He says that the Bear Cove Brook has had its 6x6 beams replaced entirely and that, “The state of some of them were completely horrible.”


Discussion about the condition of the T’Railway, and in particular the overgrowth, was also part of the discussion at the last meeting of Port aux Basques Town Council, held on Tuesday, Oct. 13.


“My concern was look – everybody’s saying ‘tourists’, and out so far as Stephenville everything is clear, but from Doyles to South Branch it’s all grown in,” said Coun. Jim Lane. “From the Chignic up to South Branch, you just can’t see. It’s dangerous.”",

  body: "I miss hockey. I know that in the grand scheme of things it’s a relatively minor grievance, but it’s been on my mind a lot lately.


Now that the summer is over it should be hockey season but it isn’t. COVID-19 is still killing people and there’s no pre-season. It’s as understandable as it is annoying.


Annoying is one of the lesser side effects of living in the midst of a global pandemic, and in truth I have little right to complain. There’s not been a single case here on the Southwest coast, and other than whipping a mask on and off every couple of minutes it’s not that bad, at least around here.


What’s going on in Québec and Ontario makes life here seem idyllic by comparison. And yet...


You can only remain annoyed so long before you start to chafe under the yoke. Lately my patience, never one of my virtues, has vanished altogether.


I’ve never been a big shopper, and when I do venture out to the stores I tend to go all at once.


On and off goes the mask, one of them anyway because I always have to carry spares. I’m either losing them or they’re in the wrong coat or in the purse that I forgot to bring.


The hand sanitizer has triggered old allergies and prompted new ones. You have to sanitize going into every single public facility, which is understandable of course.


But the cheap sanitizer – and a lot of it is actually on recall – stinks to the point where I now have to use gel saline to flush out my eyes after a trip to the shops. Just the regular drops won’t do.


Meanwhile my hands are raw from all the scrubbing because I always have to use soap and water to wash it off as soon as I get home to try to minimize the reaction.


I can’t remember to bring my re-usable bags or else they’re breaking from the constant use and rewashing. The cloth ones are a bit easier to handle than the plastic covered ones, but now I’m having to buy plastic bin liners instead of just the grocery store bags so I’m not sure the environment is better off anyway.


The constant state of being annoyed just to stay alive is tiresome and it seems there’s no end in sight. I have an endless stream of questions about our immediate and long-term future.


Is COVID-19 going to give way like the Spanish flu or the Bubonic plague? How long are the vaccine trials going to take?


Some people won’t even wear masks. Do we really expect them to sign on for a new vaccine? What if another pandemic breaks out?


Will life ever get back to “normal”, meaning pre-pandemic?


Can’t we just have hockey back so I can relax again? Please?

Without a clear path to a soccer season due to COVID-19 restrictions, both schools received permission from School Sport and District to have a AA tournament. 


Coach Lockie Macdougall of St. James Regional High says they normally play AAA, but without the numbers this year they moved to AA to be able to compete. 


“Its a seven on seven game on a smaller field. Belanger never had anyone to play against, so they gave us the opportunity to play against a smaller school.”


Over the two day tournament, which was won through total number of goals scored, St. James emerged victorious after a scoreless tie on Thursday, and a 2-1 late surge on Friday.


“Belanger scored the first goal in the second half, we tied it up, and then we scored a late one by Liam Ingram to take the 2-1 lead,” explains Macdougall, who is a graduate of Belanger Memorial himself. 


He says defeating the school he went to is “quite surreal”.


First year Coach Paul Ford of Belanger Memorial says his team had about a month of practicing once the school year started. 


“We did have a practice game, and then right into it.”


Coach Macdougall proudly stated that this Soccer Championship banner is the first ever that the school has won, and that their new championship title came only a week after the St James Girls AA team won their first ever championship. ",

  subtitles: "",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The Sou’west Newfoundland Delta Waterfowl is among the many groups having to adapt to fundraising in the time of a global pandemic.


“Normally we would have a dinner and an auction and do some raffles at the event. This year we’re not having an actual event at all,” says Chair Mark Lomond.


Usually 125 tickets are sold for the fundraising dinner, proceeds from which help to fund a $250 scholarship for a local student, support the town’s annual winter carnival fishing derby and other local groups like Autism Involves Me. Multiple prize draws are held at the dinner and Lomond says many go home with at least some small prize.


This year, Delta Waterfowl has put the prizes into three large packages and are selling the tickets for $100. Only 150 tickets are being printed, and the draws will take place on Friday, Oct. 30. Lomond estimates around a third of the tickets have been sold so far.


“There’ll be four guns, lots of artwork. There’s thousands and thousands of dollars worth of prizes,” says Lomond. “It’s really nice.”


Some of the ticket sales will naturally go towards paying for the prizes. The local chapter of Delta Waterfowl will keep 25 percent of the funds raised. The rest goes to the Delta Waterfowl foundation to further develop and maintain good conservation and hunting practices.


“They fund a lot of different causes,” notes Lomond.


The Sou’west Newfoundland chapter has put out over 100 different nesting structures in this region since it formed in 2016. They’ve also spearheaded beach cleanups, picking up garbage that would otherwise impact bird and marine life.


“We bought and installed doors for the Codroy Valley wetlands centre,” shares Lomond.

Fundraising instead of a dinner does have some upside though.


“There’s a lot less preparation, that’s for sure,” offers Lomond. “I don’t know if I’d call it easier.”


Lomond says regular dinner guests have expressed disappointment at this new fundraiser, but given the COVID-19 guidelines there’s little alternative. Those wishing to purchase tickets can reach out to any of the Sou’west Delta Waterfowl members through their Facebook page or by calling Mark at 694-2684.",

  body: "CODROY VALLEY – Residents of Codroy Valley are still driving on rough and crumbling roads despite some much needed patchwork this summer. MHA Scott Reid (St. George’s - Humber) visits the area often and has kept an eye on the repair progress.


“It’s not perfect now but it was pretty bad before,” admits Reid. “It’s been a very frustrating thing for me as well.”


Reid has singled out Block Road and Loch Lomond roads in particular, calling them ‘terrible’.


“The problem with both of those roads is that they were built in a hurry,” notes Reid. “The pavement went down over a substandard base, right, so it’s been problems pretty well right from day one.”


Reid says the cost of upgrading the Codroy Valley roads, and Block Road and Loch Lomond Road in particular, is pretty significant. This past summer he had been hoping to see the Searston to St. Andrews Road portion completed, and stated that a contract had been awarded for part of it.


“The contract was a little late getting out because of the COVID stuff, but also the company that was doing it had some trouble getting people to crush the stone,” says Reid. 

Reid had been trying to get an extension on that contract, and says he is disappointed that the work didn’t get done this year. He’s hoping to see it done early on in next year’s construction season.


In addition to Block and Loch Lomond, Reid is focused on getting repairs done to sections of road leading from Mountainside to Belanger Memorial School, and from Codroy to Woodville.


“A lot of people drive down to work in the fish plant, and the owner of the fish plant transports his fish up over that road too, and the road is getting pretty bad,” says Reid. “So those are the three sections of high traffic roads that I would like to see done.”


When it comes to the Block Road, Reid considers the repairs necessary not just for the residents but for the tourists who may wish to visit the new Coastangs Trail. The 5.5 km hike along scenic coastline is backed by the spectacular Long Range Mountains and has trailheads at Searston and St. Andrew’s. The moderate trek offers several lookout points, including those located at Barents Head, Nor’ West Cove and Larkin Point.


“If you’re going to promote that trail, you really have to have a road that’s drivable out there,” notes Reid.


He’s even reached out to the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure to suggest they use millings from Bay St. George, which has had some roads repaved, to help deal with the Block Road. While it wouldn’t be perfect, it would still be an improvement and represent a lower cost alternative.


“Until the money is there I don’t want to guarantee that it’s going to be done,” says Reid.


The MHA promises that he will keep looking at other options to find available funds to make more extensive repairs. He believes that over and above the nuisance of driving on poor roads and the wear and tear on vehicles, the issue is also becoming one of safety.


“There hasn’t been a lot of road work done, so the problem is that these roads were allowed to deteriorate over the last 20 years to the point now where I think we’re in sort of a crisis situation.”


The Department of Transportation and Infrastructure did not respond to inquiries prior to publication deadline.",

  body: "Doug Manstan didn’t want to come to Port aux Basques at first. He’s a ‘townie’ who was working with the Canadian National Railway (CNR) when he was offered the opportunity to relocate when the company chose to transition from steam engines to diesel electric.


“That was a nice job out there in Port aux Basques. That was in 1961,” recalled Manstan via telephone interview from his home in Mount Pearl.


He’d just gotten married, and late that Spring visited the area without his new bride to assess the idea.


“I wasn’t overly impressed with the place, coming from a city, to a small town like Port aux Basques,” admits Manstan.


He did have some acquaintances who personalized the visit and he familiarized himself with the pros and cons of living on the Southwest Coast. Thanks to his friends, he learned that there was good hunting and fishing, and career-wise it also made sense. Towards the end of June, he moved to Port aux Basques and his wife followed in October.


“It wasn’t just a couple of months as I thought it was going to be,” says Manstan.


One of Manstan’s acquaintances was Fred Beauchamp, a friend of his father’s. The two men had both been among the first to join the Newfoundland Rangers, the island’s police force prior to Confederation. Beauchamp owned a hardware store business by then and played a large role in introducing Manstan to the town.


“That sort of encouraged me to stay longer,” Manstan recalls.


Both he and his wife, June, became heavily involved with charitable groups in the region and developed a strong network of friends as a result. Manstan was President of the Port aux Basques Lions Club and also served for two years as President of the Port aux Basques and Area Chamber of Commerce. June was involved with the Parent-Teacher Association and the Lioness Club.


After a couple of years the busy pair started growing their family, beginning with their eldest son, Scott. Stephanie, Steve and Stanley would follow in later years.


Eventually the railway began shutting down the passenger trains and Manstan transferred to Argentia to oversee operations. That was back when the MV Ambrose Shea first began making its Summer passenger runs there.


“I went to Argentia about three or four months before the Shea came in,” remembers Manstan.


His family followed and they stayed in Argentia for about two and a half years. He says he didn’t much care for the climate, particularly the fog. They kept travelling back and forth to St. John’s but Manstan still felt restless.


“I was bored. Not enough responsibility I think.”


Things were so slow that Manstan left a message with head office that he was going into hospital for surgery and would be unavailable for ten days, then would need a month at home to recuperate. It was only when he was home and touched base with his supervisor that the company realized he’d been absent.


“I realized then that it wasn’t a very important job that I had down there then,” says Manstan.


He returned to Port aux Basques in 1970 to take on a supervisory position with the Canadian Food and Inspection Agency (CFIA), which had built an inspection station to combat the island’s potato wort problems. He stayed for eight years and afterwards started businesses in Port aux Basques, Corner Brook and St. John’s. With the potato problem cleared up and his businesses needing more of his time, Manstan retired from the CFIA.


Manstan recalls that the town was booming back then. The fish plant and the ferry service and railway were facing a shortage of employees due to growth. By 1986 his businesses were still thriving, and the Manstans were prominent figures in the town. Then tragedy struck.

Their son Scott was killed in a hang gliding accident at age 23. The Manstans decided to cut back and sold a couple of their businesses as they moved towards retirement. Then June discovered she had cancer.


“He got killed on Sept. 1, 1986. She found out she had cancer and she died on May 20, 1987. So about eight months after,” recalls Manstan. “Now it was a completely different ballgame. What was I going to do with three kids, two in university?”


In order to keep his kids close, Manstan pulled up stakes and returned to St. John’s, though he kept the house and some businesses in Port aux Basques. Steve eventually returned to help his father run some of the businesses and now owns the family home. Stephanie and Stanley are now living in Ontario. Manstan is now taking it easy in retirement.


“Port aux Basques is a nice place, even though when I first went there it was pretty depressing, but it became a beautiful place I must say. It’s too bad the businesses are gone the way they are,” says Manstan. “I think people gotta get on the go there soon and start doing something, because the government is not going to do it unless you put pressure on them. I think it’s got great potential myself. It could go back to being booming like it was.”",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Town council is hoping to secure funding for the ATV trail in order to build an extension under the overpass near Tim Horton’s. Mayor John Spencer told the Wreckhouse Weekly that this would allow for an ease of ATV traffic from Marine Atlantic along the current trail where the old rail bed runs parallel to the Trans Canada Highway.


“Government engineers were opposed for safety reasons given the glare from headlights from ATVs when getting close to the road near Tim’s,” wrote Spencer via e-mail. “The ATVs would then continue along the northside of Irving Mainway crossing the road near the museum.”


Recreational ATV tourism has been a boost for provincial tourist operators and was cited as part of the reason for the current federal and provincial investment in the Newfoundland T’Railway repairs and improvements. 


Town Manager Leon MacIsaac clarified the specific anti-glare technology being considered is the Safe-Hit Glarescreen.


“They are typically installed on concrete jersey barriers or barricades that divide traffic lanes and limit the glare from oncoming traffic. The material required for this area would include a cost of approximately $25,000 for the Glarescreens and mounting hardware and approximately $25,000 for the concrete jersey barriers to use as a separation between the ATV trail and TCH traffic,” wrote MacIsaac via e-mail.


The mayor also noted that the issue of the trail has been ongoing for quite some time, and that members of council traveling to St. John’s will include the ATV trail among the other matters they are bringing to the ministerial and technical echelons of government.


“Hopefully, the completed access for ATVs will add to an already busy Tim’s and Irving Mainway with tourists stopping before venturing into our wonderful province. And, of course, catering to the outgoing traffic as well,” wrote Spencer.

  subtitles: "Helen C. Escott is a retired civilian member of the RCMP and an award winning author. Her novels, including Operation Wormwood: The Reckoning, are available at Butterfly Book Boutique in Port aux Basques. - © Rosalyn Roy / Wreckhouse Press, Inc.",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Helen C. Escott was clearly enjoying herself during her author signing event at the Butterfly Book Boutique on Saturday, Oct. 17.


“This is so good. It’s wonderful. As an author you kind of work in a bubble, right? You kind of sit with your characters all day and you don’t see a lot of the outside world,” says Escott. “I love meeting people.”


The award winning St. John’s-based author is a retired civilian member of the RCMP and draws extensively on that experience to pen her crime thrillers, including her fifth and latest novel – Operation Wormwood: The Reckoning. Escott is particularly delighted to find a fan in Valerie Parsons, an independent book retailer who has been actively promoting Escott’s books, even though the two had no prior connection.


“But isn’t that just Newfoundland? We help each other and we do support local authors,” says Escott. “I know authors over in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and P.E.I. who’ll say, ‘ You know we don’t get the support that you guys get. You’re out doing book signings. People invite you in.’”


Escott says that authors in Vancouver, for instance, will tell her that readers will reject local books whereas in Newfoundland, where our culture is so closely tied to our music and stories, local is always popular.


“It’s fabulous when we get this support. It’s so unique to us, especially as an artist in COVID times. You know bookstores basically shut down in February, never opened again until almost June, that... nobody sold books.”


Escott includes her publisher, Flanker Press among the province’s book retailers who have struggled during the pandemic and resulting restrictions. Backups at Canada Post also impacted online sales, and Escott says people sometimes had to wait months to get their order. 


“Newfoundlanders buy a lot of books. They’re a very well read people. My theory on it is we’re an island of storytellers,” says Escott. “You can’t be a good storyteller if you don’t read stories.”


As part of her provincial tour, Escott also stopped in at Corner Brook and Grand Falls. Last fall she also toured Corner Brook, Gander and Clarenville as well as the Avalon. This trip was brief since her husband, Robert, has to go back to work.


“He’s my bodyguard, my sherpa, my coffee getter,” laughs Escott.


In fact, Robert is the primary inspiration for Nicholas Myra, the protagonist of the Operation Wormwood books. Escott has no trouble basing characters on people she knows, who tend to be flattered by it. The realism and detail she puts into her novels means some fans become heavily invested, sometimes reaching out to her because they’re worried she will kill off a beloved character.


In her books, Escott deliberately uses St. John’s itself as a character.


“When I write I can kind of see it, I can see the movie,” says Escott, who truly believes that someday her books will be optioned to film. “If you’re going to make this movie, you can’t make it in Nova Scotia and pretend to be St. John’s, because the landmarks in the book are so important and I did that on purpose.”


Escott also spends considerable time and effort on research for her novels, even letting former colleagues and acquaintances double check sections to verify they comply with how an actual investigation would unfold.


“I’m meeting with a police officer next week who is an expert on human trafficking,” shares the author. “I don’t want a police officer to read this book and go, ‘Oh no. That would never happen.’ That’s not the way it’s done.”


Currently she’s speaking to law enforcement experts as she researches her next book, which she hopes will be released next Fall, that will see protagonists Myra and McNaughton team up for a joint Federal and Provincial investigation into sex trafficking. Escott says Newfoundland is by no means exempt from the practice, which exploits millions of women and children annually.


“When you look at organized crime and their top three moneymakers, number one is drugs, number two is arms and number three is women and children.”


She cites Hookers in the Holy Land, a report on the rampant sex trafficking in Israel, and zeroes in on cultural and ethnic bias.


“They would never expect their women to do this kind of stuff, so they bring in Russian women or Polish women, and they’re literally kidnapped off the street.”


Escott’s details of how the women and even young girls are tricked, then raped until broken are simultaneously harrowing and revolting. Even the police services in some of the more notorious countries are complicit.


“No little girl grows up wanting to be a prostitute,” notes Escott. “I get so enraged when I see these specialty groups wanting to legalize prostitution. What you’re doing is you’re legalizing the sex slave business. You’re legalizing slavery for women and children is what you’re doing. That is the vote.”


Escott wrote a blog about the sex trade she later sent to St. John City council. At the time, councillors and special groups were examining whether or not to allow more massage parlours.


“I went to them and I said what you’re voting on is not, ‘Do I want more massage parlours’, cause they have a ban on it right now,” shares Escott. “It’s do I want the City to be involved in the sex trafficking and sex slavery of women and children? That’s what you’re saying yes or no to.”


Escott once asked a police officer how to stop sex trafficking and sexual slavery once and for all.


“She said to me it stops when men stop buying women and children,” recounts Escott. “You can buy a woman. You can buy a child. And that’s the world we live in.”


Escott believes the key to changing that world is to raise better men and stop protecting the offenders in an effort to avoid small town gossip or scandal. She offers a typical scenario where instead of reporting an abusive uncle, family members and friends will simply make sure he has no access to or alone time with their children.

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Last Monday, Oct 19, while fishing about a half mile off Channel Head, Andy and Jeff Porter hauled up something unusual – a Canadian National Railway (CNR) cup.


Jeff is an offshore fisher and his son Andy had come along for the day. They had set their gear earlier that morning and had left it soaking for a couple of hours before starting to haul it back in.


“All I heard was, ‘What in the name of God is that coming there?’ and he started to laugh,” shares Andy, doing a bit of chuckling himself. “When I looked it was a mug.”


Andy quickly snapped a couple of photos of his father still holding the intact cup before they unhooked it. He says they’ve hooked up pants and even a shoe before, but this is the first time they’ve pulled in some china.


The yellow mug is surprisingly intact, and the stamp and information at the bottom are entirely legible. Andy says his father believes it may have come from the MV William Carson.


Andy has already cleaned it up and put it to good use.


“I carried it out to Dad, trying it out with a cup of tea!”",
