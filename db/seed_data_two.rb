  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – There used to be a building standing on the corner of First Choice Convenience store, but owner Jeannette Tobin didn’t know that before Saturday, Oct. 24. She was completely surprised when the backhoe brought up piles of wood, canvas and other materials before reaching the largely intact concrete foundation of an old basement about 10 feet beneath the store’s parking lot.


“We are getting water in our basement, so we figured it must be outside,” explains Tobin. “When we started digging up this is what we found.”


Tobin had no idea the structure was there when she first bought the store five years ago. She says there was nothing on the property deed or surveys, and she has no idea how far the basement extends or if anything else lies buried beneath the rest of her parking lot.


“What they did is they just buried everything,” she says. “We never knew it was there. We’ve been walking on it all along.”


Friend Barry Musseau says, “I’m 99.99 percent sure. There used to be an old barber shop there. Russell Anderson’s.”


Musseau says that was about 55 years ago, back when he was just a wee lad. He’s 61 now. He remembers being a little boy going for haircuts. Anderson died tragically in a car accident on Barachois Hill.


Tobin wonders aloud if the barber shop was actually next door. This unearthed basement might have been an old store or a private home. She remembers walking down steps that weren’t quite level with the road.


Musseau shouts back over the howl of a crisp autumn wind laced with the threat of snow. Workers have moved to another hole, closer to the current store’s basement, still looking for that elusive leaky water pipe.


Musseau recalls Johnny and Calvin Warren building the current First Choice Convenience Store, which they eventually sold to the Porters. He peers down into the basement, hoping to spot a forgotten pair of hair clippers which might clarify what this building used to be.


“Might find buried treasure down there!” chuckles Tobin.


So far the only treasure they’ve unearthed is a battered orange and brown Frostie Root Beer can. Some research reveals that brand was manufactured by Pepsi Cola beginning in 1939. It was available in Newfoundland from 1964 until the mid-seventies.


Those cans are currently selling for $11.88 on eBay, but only if it’s still in mint condition with the drink inside. Otherwise all Tobin is going to get for that is a good story, because it’s not in good enough condition to get the five cent deposit returned at the local recycling depot.


Nadine Osmond, Chair of the Southwest Coast Historical Society, isn’t entirely able to help clear up the confusion. She has some old photos of Main Street as it was back in the fifties and sixties, and adds another name into the mix.


Edna Davis’ father had a small shop next to the Brake house and Hulan’s barber shop. Osmond is inclined to believe it’s the basement of Frank Brake’s old house, and thinks the old barber shop is now the house next door to First Choice. But she can’t declare it with absolute certainty.


“It’s hard to say exactly what the foundation found today was. If it wasn’t Frank Brake’s house it could possibly have been Eric Hulan’s barber shop as well,” offers Osmond. “Edna Davis’ father’s store, that would have been torn down, and then I guess Frank Brake’s house was torn down. And the house and the store would be, I guess, the parking lot to First Choice Convenience.”


Whatever the building used to be will have to give way to what it must now become. Once the water problem is fixed, Tobin has the old concrete basement filled back in. First Choice Convenience is there now and it still needs the parking space.",

  subtitles: "Mittens.- courtesy of Velda Tapp Pretty",
  body: "Judge Lynn Cole is expected to hand down her decision in the Mittens animal cruelty case in a Stephenville courtroom on December 1, 2020.


Jody Anderson, 39, of Cape Ray has been charged with two counts of unlawfully causing an animal unnecessary suffering (CCC 2008 [445.1]) and one count of injuring or endangering an animal (CCC 1985 [445.a]). Peter Rossiter of the Codroy Valley has been charged with one count of unlawfully causing an animal unnecessary suffering (CCC 2008 [445.1]) and one count of injuring or endangering an animal (CCC 1985 [445.a]).


The charges stem from allegations that the two killed a rescue cat named Mittens with an axe at Anderson’s residence in Port aux Basques in September of 2019.


During a one day trial held in Port aux Basques on Wednesday, Oct. 29, Crown Prosecutor Jill Quilty called three witnesses, beginning with Constable Leon Sheppard. The RCMP officer presented crime scene photographs which he believes shows blood stains on the bathroom floor. However, upon cross examination by the defense he revealed that the stains had not actually been tested for feline blood.


Velda Tapp Pretty, a volunteer with In Memory of Shadow cat rescue group, testified that Mittens belonged to the group but was being fostered by Anderson after the cat’s original owner had died.


The third crown witness, who stated that she was afraid of the accused, gave two statements to the RCMP. Two weeks after initially denying any knowledge of the incident, she gave a second statement to investigators. Under questioning by Quilty, the witness testified that the two took the cat into the bathroom, though she could not recall who carried it.


“I saw Mr. Rossiter and Ms. Anderson going into the bathroom with an axe and a garbage bag, a black garbage bag. They come back out with no cat and they were going to dump it somewhere,” testified the witness.


The witness stated that she did not venture into the bathroom herself.


Neither Anderson nor Rossiter testified in their own defense, nor did their attorneys call any witnesses on their behalf.


If convicted summarily, the charges can result in fines of up to ten thousand dollars and possible imprisonment for up to eighteen months. If convicted under an indictable offense, the defendants can be sentenced up to five years imprisonment.",

  body: "SOUTHWEST COAST – April Anderson isn’t much of a birder, but even she knew there was something strange about the large bird that landed near St. James Elementary School on Monday afternoon, Oct. 26.


“First I thought it was a goose, but noticed it looked different than the other geese I have seen. It didn’t appear injured. I figured it was confused. But it was really tame which confused me even more, so I contacted the Devoe Ranch (in Codroy Valley) to see if it was one of their birds, but it wasn’t,” stated Anderson, who had been at the school to pick up her daughter.


Anderson informed a nearby fishery officer.


“It didn’t even hiss at them and they were around the bird,” observed Anderson.


Wildlife officials transported what was later identified as a tundra swan to the Codroy Valley, where it was safely released into the Grand Codroy Estuary. The protected wetland site has in excess of 925 hectares and has been recognized internationally for its importance and diverse species of it attracts. Even so, Mark Lomond estimates there hasn’t been another tundra swan spotted in this area for about 20 years.


Lomond is the chair of the Sou’wes Newfoundland Delta Waterfowl and says that the tundra swan is a bird that normally doesn’t come anywhere near here. A migration map provided by Sou’wes Delta shows that the species doesn’t usually venture further east in Canada beyond the Quebec-Ontario border.


“This is apparently the third, possibly fourth, on record for the province I’m told. With one in Codroy in the early 2000s,” stated Lomond.


Avid birdwatchers have already rushed to the estuary to see the swan, including trio Denise McIsaac, Randoph White and Tina Randell. They were successful in finding the swan, and all three agree that the trip was well worth it even if the weather was a bit unpleasant at times.

“It was a little inclement coming out. It was rain and snow and a bit of fog, all three combined,” says White, who has a background in aviation and is fascinated with flight. He’s been a birdwatcher for a long time. “For me, I find it’s medicinal. You forget everything. If you can appreciate what a bird is and what it does, how it moves around, and it flies, that’s pretty amazing.”


White’s excitement is palpable and equally shared by his traveling companions.

Randell is happy to report that when they spotted it, the swan seemed content to hang around with the large number of geese currently in residence at the estuary. This is her third birdwatching trip to the estuary this summer.


“It’s flying nicely. It’s not injured or anything,” says Randell. “I managed to get probably 10, 15 shots in flight because it circled around us.”


MacIsaac believes the swan may have been in shock when it first landed at the school. She’s been birdwatching for about four years, and that the group got lucky finding the tundra swan so quickly given the enormous size of the estuary.


“His colour is in our favour. He’s white, and really big. He’s really big. It didn’t take too long,” says McIsaac. “Birds are exciting, especially the rare ones. This one is definitely up there.”

It’s the very first time all three of them have ever seen a tundra swan in person and likely the last, at least in this province.


“We’re not going to see this bird again, probably ever,” says White. “It’s pretty amazing.”


Lomond speculates the swan may linger for a while in the estuary, hopefully providing himself and other avid birdwatchers with more opportunities to come out for a look.


“It will stay long enough to get back to good health and then I suspect when all the geese sense it’s time start migrating it will too,” says Lomond. “The tundra swan spends summers up in places like Nunavut and can handle our weather conditions fine. It’s also a dabbler so it can tip up on the surface and reach far down to reach shellfish and plants. It will have no issue surviving here.”

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The St. James Regional High School ladies softball team defeated the rival team from Corner Brook Regional High School on Saturday, Oct. 24 to secure the regional championship in a best of three format. They won by a score of 14 to 6 in the first game and 15 to 10 in the second game to claim the title.


“Due to COVID that’s all we had, just the one team come out,” said Coach Steve Lefrense. “It would be what we could class as a regional, but that’s probably as far as we’re going to go this year, right now at least.”


Lefrense says that if restrictions ease off as the pandemic situation improves and a provincial tournament is announced, then St. James would play.


The St. James team is comprised of females in grade 10, 11 and 12 but Lefrense is quick to point out that some members of the team grew up playing ball in Isle aux Morts in their younger years, and are now attending high school in Port aux Basques. That experience allowed them to serve as veterans to some of their teammates who hadn’t played the sport before.


Lefrense has taken a leave of absence from serving on Isle aux Morts council to relocate to Port aux Basques, but expects to resign by year end. He’s been part of their ball program for years, first as a young player and eventually as a coach. Now he’s keen to develop a similar all girls program in Port aux Basques.


“Even in that short 10 or 12 practices that we did have, I saw an immense improvement in a lot of those girls,” shares LeFrense. “


The coach says that a lot of the players are athletes who are transitioning into softball during the pandemic.


“There’s a lot of school sports that are just not on the table due to COVID,” notes Lefrense. “There is no school volleyball, basketball. There’s no school floor hockey.”


Once softball was given the green light by School Sports NL (SSNL) for 2020, Lefrense started canvassing the students to build a team. Out of the 19 players who tried out, 12 were selected for this year’s team, but the coach says there’s enough interest now that he anticipates having more next summer.


“If we could even get three teams then I would be happy, because we would have a three team league and we would be playing a couple of games each week,” says the coach. “I’ve pretty much got the same team next year and probably even the following year.”


Anyone interested in learning more or signing up to play next season should contact Steve Lefrense via Facebook.",

  body: "I am reproducing below the essence of an email I sent to my cell service provider (Virgin Mobile) regarding the quality of cell service available in the Codroy Valley.


I have a house in O’Regans which I occupy seasonally. Virgin is wholly owned by Bell Canada and uses its tower infrastructure for the service it provides in Newfoundland. I have contacted Virgin about the poor service described below.


Given the complaints I heard about service to that area, I thought this may be of interest to your readers. I am not optimistic for a resolution but others may want to join in.


“Given the high wind conditions that prevail in that area and high road traffic to the ferry terminal, to have sections of highway and surrounding communities absent a cell signal poses dangerous possibilities. Cell coverage can no longer be considered a luxury and improvements are badly needed.


“I spent six weeks in the Codroy Valley (southwestern Newfoundland) from August to September. Service coverage that is advertised as being LTE was totally unsatisfactory.


“Dropped calls are frequent and the additional data I purchased was almost useless because of a poor cell signal. Residents of this area regularly are purchasing cell boosters to access service. This is not specific to any one area.


“The Codroy Valley communities are some 35 kms from Port aux Basques. The geography of this area is within the corridor of theTrans Canada Highway and it is a high traffic section especially for transport traffic and travel to the ferry terminus at Port aux Basques.


“My need to call an ambulance was potentially compromised as I had to move about my property to get a signal. I feel your service is not as advertised and it is poor value for money. The towers serving the area appear inadequate and a review is needed to provide better cell service.”",

You may find that you can be the recipient of valuable information if you’re willing to be a good listener. Look into events that you might find interesting, and compromise by doing a few things that you both like to do. Your emotions will be touched off concerning recent encounters with your lover.


TAURUS 

You might find it difficult to control your emotions. Don’t overreact to someone’s advances. You’ll be angry if those you live with aren’t pulling their weight.


GEMINI 

Get involved in the activities of children. They will teach you far more than you expect. Communications with loved ones may be strained. Things at home may be somewhat rocky.


CANCER 

You will have good ideas for home improvement projects. Put some energy into getting back into shape. Listen to reason. Use your ingenuity to manipulate things to get what you want. Someone you live with will be impossible.


LEO 

New relationships could evolve through group activities. Your mind is on moneymaking ventures. You won’t be well received by superiors or by your spouse.


VIRGO 

Arguing won’t help. You may come down with minor infections if you have allowed yourself to get rundown. Listening can be more valuable than being a chatterbox.


LIBRA 

You might want to spend some time by yourself in order to decide exactly how you feel. Intellectual stimulation is what you are looking for. Travel opportunities should be your first choice.


SCORPIO 

Try to put your money away for a rainy day. Your temper could get the better of you if you confront personal situations. Don’t count on others to cover up for your shortcomings.


SAGITTARIUS 

You need to start planning that vacation. Observations will be far more productive. Any financial limitations will probably have to be dealt with on your own.


CAPRICORN 

You will be highly sensitive to comments made by your lover. Plan a day of enjoyment with them. If you can put some work into home improvements, you should. 


AQUARIUS 

Remain calm and you’ll shine. Passion should be your goal. Any contributions you make to organizations will enhance your reputation and bring you offers. Try to channel your energy into physical work.


PISCES 

You can work in conjunction with those in the know in order to get to the bottom of things. Remember – talk to them, not at them. You should consider submitting some of your written work.",

  subtitles: "Frank Spencer proudly displays some of his crafts and handiwork, made mostly from old vehicle parts. - © J. René Roy",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – On an old desk inside the front door of Spencer’s Auto Ltd., a shiny metal figurine cobbled together out of used car parts greets customers. Red, white and green wires poking out of the top give the illusion of hair, and his huge ears sport tiny washer earrings.


This is Frank Spencer’s handiwork, part of the way he passed the time during the COVID-19 shutdown. The garage, like many businesses, has since re-opened.


“I do this stuff to take the boredom out of my job,” says Spencer.


‘This stuff’ is what he calls his mechanic art. Chains, keys, bolts, pistons, carburetor parts are all fair game. No two pieces are alike but they are all somehow recognizable as his distinct artwork. He likes to post pictures of them to Facebook, and that’s where Lew Skinner spotted them.


Skinner is a member of the Ducats band, and Spencer has been friends with the members for years.


“He said, ‘When you get time I want you to make me a guitar’. He meant one a foot long,” says Spencer.


Whenever he travels to St. John’s, Spencer likes to visit his old buddy. On one trip they were examining Skinner’s guitars, including a 1961 Fender Stratocaster.


“I just decided to make him a guitar, so I researched the dimensions on the guitar, and I decided that it was easier to make a full sized guitar than a little small one,” offers Spencer.


Some of the car parts Spencer used to make the guitar had been laying around for years. One part is from fisher Vern Prosser’s boat engine. Another belonged to Jim Currie, off the engine of his car he used to race in Stephenville. There’s a carburetor off the White Fleet.


“The White Fleet was a railway service crew. They had all their coaches painted white,” says Spencer. “So there’s representation there of the fishing industry, the railway, racing in Stephenville, and the elementary school.”


Spencer gave careful thought to each piece he selected to craft Lou Skinner’s guitar. The guitar strap is the centre of the seatbelt off a Dodge Ram snowplow. It took about four months, working as time permitted, to construct the 35-pound guitar.


It’s unfortunately not playable, but Spencer didn’t intend for it to be either. He turned away donations of guitar strings from musicians. Metal warps too much when it’s welded, he says, and anyway he wanted it to be mechanical, not musical. The guitar strings are made from the wire used in motors for automatic car seats.


“There’s 99 nuts in the neck,” he points out. “You can make it playable but then you wouldn’t have the appearance.”


In November, when he returns to St. John’s, he plans to get more photos of the guitar, circle the parts and on the back of the photos share the history behind it, and put it all in a frame as a keepsake that he can show people. When he’s gone, people will still know the story of the people behind the guitar and why that part was chosen to build it.


Nelson Cousins was a mentor for Frank Spencer. A talented mechanic, he also offered Spencer valuable life lessons and advice.


“Nelson was a wise man. I know he didn’t always appear to be,” says Spencer, “but he was a smart individual.”


When the unique guitar was done, Spencer had a friend deliver it to Skinner in St. John’s. A grateful Skinner then gave Spencer a guitar strap someone had made for him down in the United States back in the sixties.


“I got a pair of cuff-links, gold cuff-links, with Ducats 1957 engraved, and I told him I didn’t do it for that,” shares Spencer.


Skinner responded by cussing at him.


“He told me where to go!” laughs Spencer.",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Count the Royal Canadian Legion as being among the volunteer organisations impacted by COVID-19. Nelson Lillington, who has been serving as President of Branch 11 for about a year and a half, says that Remembrance Day will look a little different this year.


“There will not be a formal ceremony due to the restrictions placed on gatherings. Wreaths will still be laid at the Cenotaph,” shared Lillington via e-mail.


He and other volunteers with Royal Canadian Legion will be on hand between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. to assist those who wish to lay a wreath, or lay the wreath on behalf of those unable to attend.


“Everyone understands the changes the fact that health and safety of people is the priority. We feel the way that we have organised the event factors this in while still allowing the Remembrance of family and loved ones,” wrote Lillington.


The annual poppy campaign has also been adjusted to deal with the new reality of living in a global pandemic. Participating businesses will allow patrons to buy a poppy to wear and there will still be a table at the Grand Bay Mall to purchase a poppy, but there will be no door to door canvassing for donations.


“While these changes will have an impact on fundraising for the Poppy Fund, we still expect to have a successful campaign,” stated Lillington.


The annual Legion Poppy Fund offers financial assistance and support to Veterans and their families who are in need. The funds can help with everything from food and utilities to clothing, medical and emergency shelter and much more.


“There are also other ways that anyone who wishes to (can) make a donation,” advises Lillington.


Donations can also be sent to Branch 11 directly, and by cheque or online to the National Poppy Trust Fund.


The Legion President served for 25 years in the Royal Canadian Navy as a Naval Communicator, 16 of which were spent on various ships.


“During my time in the Navy I learnt the value and importance of teamwork and leadership. Those lessons I use every day in my personal life as well as the President of Branch 11,” shared Lillington.


One of the biggest challenges he is facing is simply maintaining the Branch 11 building. The roof is in urgent need of replacement, and with a four-month closure due to the pandemic the Branch has not been able to raise the necessary funds. Lillington hopes to raise money this winter so that the roof can be replaced early next Spring. His goal is to make the facility a more comfortable and welcoming place for local Veterans.


“Hopefully, over the next few years the Branch is able to raise the funds required to make the building more appealing to veterans and to the general public to visit, enjoy some entertainment and tell a few stories.”",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The Salvation Army’s annual Christmas Kettle Campaign will look a bit different this year, says Lieutenant Maurice Collins. For the first time in many years there will be no kettles at Foodland, which is owned by Sobey’s. Instead there will be a staffed kettle at Canadian Tire.


“We understand it totally. It’s all about keeping people safe,” says Collins. “Foodland has been very supportive of us. They really help us out throughout the year as well.”


There will also be no congregating allowed around the kettle, and volunteers will be wearing masks and gloves to comply with COVID-19 guidelines. Every time someone drops money into the kettle, it will have to be wiped down and sanitized. There will also be hand sanitizer available for people who choose to make cash donations.


“This year we have something new. It’s called Tip Tap,” shares Collins. “You can take out whatever form of payment you want to use – debit card, credit card – just hold it up to the little box that’s there, and it automatically debits your account. So that way you don’t have to touch anything or we don’t have to clean it after. So it’s a very safe unit.”


Coleman’s grocery store is also providing space for an unstaffed Tip Tap kettle this year, and there will also be a cash and debit kettle stationed at the Salvation Army Thrift Store on Main Street. In addition, the Salvation Army will not be handing out any paper products to donors.


“We used to give out a calendar or some printed material and this year we will not be giving that out,” advises Collins. “While we don’t have any cases here now in Port aux Basques that we know of does not mean that we will not have any cases. So we need to protect our community, and we need to protect our volunteers and follow the guidelines that the Chief Medical Officer of our province is telling us to do.”


This year the Salvation Army will also not be holding its annual Food Bank drop off campaign, but Collins notes that the Ministerial Association always does the Christmas food boxes. There is an online application available to register for both the food and the toy campaigns. Collins advises residents from South Branch to Rose Blanche - Harbour Le Cou to contact their local church for any assistance. 


“This year instead of giving out food, we’re going to be giving out gift cards to the grocery stores,” says Collins.


By giving out gift cards, it prevents a mass congregation of people picking up their food.

“When we’ve done the food drive up at the church, there’s 70 or 80 people there just waiting to get in,” says Collins. “Last year it was a snowstorm. Last year was really nasty, and I think the year before was really nasty. I just don’t think it’s good for a person’s self-esteem to be standing there.”


Instead, families who receive a gift card will be given a specific appointment time to come collect it at their church. Collins says the amount on the gift card will naturally vary depending on the size of the family.


“They can go to the grocery store and pick up their own groceries and not be stereotyped,” says Collins, who concedes there is still a stigma associated with the Christmas hampers and Food Bank.


While he won’t know the final number for the Christmas food hampers until mid-December, Collins anticipates a significant increase in demand. Almost two full months before Christmas, the Salvation Army has already noticed an increase in the number of residents requesting assistance from the weekly Food Bank.


“When COVID first started it slacked back, and we don’t know why it slacked back, but since September we’ve seen an increase in Food Bank,” shares Collins. “Probably a fifty percent increase. It’s a huge increase and we’re seeing numbers now that we haven’t seen in a while, and I think as the cold weather goes on it’s going to get worse.”


Currently the Food Bank is operated on Mondays from 9:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. by appointment only. Residents are given a time to stop by the Thrift Store location and groceries will be put out by the back door for collection.


If it seems like the Salvation Army is adhering strictly to rigid pandemic protocols, that’s because it is. Collins says the store alone has to be constantly cleaned. After it closes at 4:30 p.m., staff must spend at least a half hour sanitizing the entire facility. It’s a lot more work for the volunteers.


“We’ve got a person on the front door, specifically, for when you walk in they clean the door handles on the inside and on the outside,” says Collins. “A lot of hand sanitizer.”


Donations are restricted to Fridays only. Staff must keep the dropped items for a mandated period of time before they can be opened, and masks and gloves must be worn while sorting.


Says Collins, “I don’t know what kind of impact the kettles will have for us this year with COVID. I guess time will tell.”


The kettles will be in place at Canadian Tire, Coleman’s and the Thrift Store beginning Thursday, Nov. 12, remaining open for donations until lunchtime on Christmas Eve.


“We’ve extended it an extra week this year because, well, mainly because we just need to be out there.”",

  subtitles: "Jersey Gaudet.- courtesy of Brittany Gaudet",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – How would you feel if the light of your life was shut off not once, but twice? Not many find themselves in this scenario but unfortunately for Brittany Gaudet, this is her everyday life.


On June 21, 2016, Brittany received heart wrenching news. Thirteen weeks pregnant at the time, she learned that her beloved oldest daughter, Ava, then four, had been diagnosed with late infantile Battens disease (CLN2).


Battens Disease is a terminal neurodegenerative disorder that affects the nervous system. Only 20 children are born with this disorder each year in the United States. Children with CLN2 disease produce insufficient levels of the enzyme TPP1 (tripeptidyl peptidase 1).

Without this enzyme, children are genetically unable to dispose of wastes normally metabolized in a cell’s lysosomes. The wastes accumulate in organs, particularly the brain and retina, contributing to the loss of cognitive, motor and visual functions. Symptoms usually appear between ages two to four. Ava passed away when she was only five and a half years young on Aug. 30, 2017. 


For most people this would be a devastating and crippling blow. Many would have packed up, shut down and run far away. But Brittany didn’t get that choice.


Instead she had to pick up the pieces of her heart and put them back together for her remaining family. That included daughters Cali, who was three, and Jersey, who was only eight months old. She and her children did all they could to cherish their time together. Life seemed better and happier for the family until tragedy struck again.


On Dec. 7, 2019, Jersey, then three years old, had a seizure in the family home. 


“She coughed,” said Gaudet, “but not a normal cough. As a mother you just know when something sounds or looks off.”


Immediately Brittany took out her phone and started recording. From past experience she knew that the neurologist would need to see it in action, and Brittany needed to time the seizure.


Jersey experienced what’s known as an ‘absent seizure’, which is far different than the grand mal seizures Ava used to have. The seizure lasted a long six minutes. Brittany jumped into action and grabbed Ava’s old and expired medication she had left over and administered it to Jersey. She then promptly took her daughter to the hospital. 

Five days after that first seizure, Jersey and Brittany were at the St. John’s Janeway Children’s Hospital. They were getting ready to leave for the journey home when Jersey had her second seizure.


This particular seizure lasted 45 minutes and needed three different medications to stop it. Jersey was then admitted to the Janeway for a total of five days, but doctors advised that she stay close by for the next few days in case of any side affects from the medication.  

On Dec. 30, 2019 Brittany got the call confirming what she already feared – Jersey was diagnosed with CLN2 – the same disorder that ripped her older sister away. Since then, Jersey has been approved for a new ERT (enzyme replacement treatment) called Brineura.

This treatment requires Brittany and her children to travel to St. John’s bi-weekly so that Jersey can receive an ICV (intracerebroventricular) injection via a port in her brain, which was placed in via brain surgery. This treatment is life-sustaining and will delay the onset of symptoms, all except for Jersey’s eyesight which will eventually fail. Jersey will receive this treatment for the rest of her life. 


Months after it all began, Gaudet is coping the best she can.


“The sky is the limit for my kids. I won’t stop until I can do all I can for them.” 


It goes to show that you can conquer what you put your mind to, even in the toughest of situations. A mother’s love goes above and beyond.",

  subtitles: "In August 2020, Port aux Basques announced that the affordable housing plan had been cancelled due to funding constraints. Co-operative housing initiatives, like the one currently being discussed for the Codroy Valley area, may prove a viable alternative for many in the area, not just seniors.",
  body: "SOUTHWEST COAST – Can a co-operative housing initiative in the Codroy Valley prove a viable alternative to affordable housing? Is there enough interest to move ahead with a feasibility plan? These are two of the key questions that were being asked by the Leading Edge Credit Union (LECU) on Wednesday evening, Oct. 28.


The virtual chat was led by CEO Cory Munden, who stated that the idea for a possible co-operative initiative was sparked after asking residents in the region what role the LECU could play to help make communities a better place to live, work and play. One of the challenges identified in the Codroy Valley area centred around housing.


Specifically, Munden pointed out that seniors may be unable or unwilling to keep up with their private homes, and may choose to relocate to larger urban centres that offer different housing alternatives.


“This was a similar exercise that we did in the Port aux Basques area, when we assisted a group of concerned citizens who were very concerned about the lack of child care services,” noted Munden. “We assisted them in forming a co-operative to provide child care services and it’s in its second year of operation, and it’s performing extremely well.”


Under the co-operative housing model, members are shareholders and are elected to board positions. They each pay a monthly fee, called a Housing Charge, and are both tenant and landlord. Members set policies and when one chooses to vacate, their shares are returned to the co-op, which then invites in a new member.


This can be particularly appealing for seniors living on a fixed budget, since their monthly charges are always tightly controlled. Others who tend to explore co-op housing include long-term renters who would like to explore ownership instead, low-income families or young couples just starting out.


Rosalind Langer is executive director for Co-operative Housing Association of Newfoundland and Labrador (CHANAL). 


“There’s no down payment, but you do have to buy shares in the housing co-op,” stated Langer, who has been living in co-operative housing unit since 1983. Currently the shares in her co-op are around $1,000. “The price of shares is considerably less than a down payment.”


The Housing Charge is always determined by the elected board at their annual budget meeting. Operating costs are the only real reason for any increases to the monthly payment, and since the model is non-profit, the charge is almost always lower than the traditional for-profit private rental.


“My co-op’s housing charge right now is at $695. We are in an area where the same type of units are at $1300 and $1400,” shared Langer.


In her presentation, Langer noted that there are currently 21 housing co-operatives in the province, for a total of 396 units. The type of units built can vary, from larger apartment style complexes to duplexes to stand-alone units. She said the sense of community within a co-operative housing structure is ultimately a large part of the appeal.


Langer also offered some suggestions for finding initial investment money to kickstart co-operative housing units in the region.


“You might do some fundraising, approach a politician, approach Newfoundland and Labrador housing,” she said. “I know with the new national housing initiative that’s on the go, there’s some funding that you can avail of.”


Langer pointed out that there’s lots of ways to raise money towards the initiative beyond just seed money for the mortgage, and lots of other logistics to figure out first too.


“The property that you are going to own – are you going to have that donated? Are you going to look to the government, if they have the surplus land?” she asked rhetorically. “You can go to your town. Sometimes they will give you a startup donation. There’s lot of different things you can do.”


Langer says that launching a housing co-op usually boils down to the commitment and determination of the people involved.


Given the lack of affordable, accessible housing in the region, the LECU is keen to help facilitate a co-operative housing initiative.


“This is definitely a good alternative – I think it’s the best alternative – to address the housing requirements,” concluded Munden. “For the business community especially in the area, and for the well being of what makes up a community, having this type of housing in the area I think would be fabulous.”


Anyone interested in learning more about the co-operative housing initiative are invited to contact Candace Matthews, Member Relations and Communications Specialist at the LECU, via email at cmatthews@lecu.ca or by calling (709)695-7061. Copies of the presentation in its entirety are currently available on the LECU’s Youtube channel.",

  body: "ISLE AUX MORTS – Members of the town council met on Sept. 21, 2020. Here are some of the highlights from that meeting.

Upgrades

Installation of the new culvert for Barachois Road has been completed. The platform for the playground has also been purchased and built. After a tourist had a bit of trouble finding Harvey’s Trail, council decided to put flags on the poles next year.

The walking track extension has been approved. The Age Friendly project has approved the extension to the existing track and upgrades will include installation of benches and more sods. This project will be done in Summer 2021.

Capital works

Council resolved to request an approval to borrow from the Bank of Nova Scotia $65,727 for a five year term (eight year amortization) at a rate of 2 percent plus prime (currently 2.45 percent) for the water and sewer project. Council resolved to further request and approval to borrow the HST rebate in the amount of $ 67,526 to be repaid over a term/amortization a rate of 2 percent plus prime (currently 2.45%) of 1 year. Funding is required for the town’s portion of the capital work projects, which began on Sept. 22 and was projected to last 40 working days.

Rink

Council had posted a request for volunteers but were unable to find any takers, so it was decided not to proceed with the rink this winter. The announcement was made on the town’s Facebook page last week.

Thanks were extended to Coun. Steve Lefrense for his work on the rink in the past, as well as his other volunteer efforts.

Lefrense, who once served as mayor, is on a temporary leave of absence after a recent move to Port aux Basques, which he has disclosed will likely remain permanent.",

  subtitles: "MHA Andrew Parsons (Burgeo - LaPoile) is Minister has been keeping busy as Minister of Industry, Energy & Techology. - submitted",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – MHA Andrew Parsons (Burgeo - LaPoile) announced on Thursday, Nov. 5 that two new government jobs would be relocating to Port aux Basques from Stephenville. The two positions will be with Immigration, Skills and Labour (ISL), formerly known as Advanced Education, Skills and Labour (AESL). 


“In the grand scheme of things it seems small but I think it is significant,” said Parsons via phone interview. “We’re going to see two full time positions transfer from Stephenville to the Port aux Basques office.”


The two offices are closely linked, with Port aux Basques falling in under the Stephenville office.


“The department looked at it and said it would be a good move for continuity purposes,” offered Parsons.


The minister noted that high staffing turnover is typical in other offices, but that isn’t the case in Port aux Basques. It is hoped that this will be the case for these two new positions as well.


“We haven’t had a new position in that office for over a decade,” said Parsons.


Parsons has been working to move the two positions over to the Lomond building location for about eight months. Staffing the positions will likely be done through normal government procedure, which may mean an internal posting first before an external posting is listed.


“Either way, when I see two full time jobs – government jobs – go to our area, then it’s a pretty cool thing,” says Parsons.


In the meantime, Parsons says that the cold storage feasibility study is still underway. He shared that on a personal level, he believes that the only logical place for a cold storage facility for live seafood being shipped by transport trailers is in Port aux Basques, but that the government obviously requires proof positive that is the case.


The department of Industry, Energy and Technology has also unveiled a $30 million dollar package. The funds are available to small businesses and non-profit organizations.


“It’s meant to help defray costs because of COVID,” says Parsons, “I’m saying to every small business out there: apply.”


Applications for the Small Business Assistance Program are available online at the provincial website: gov.nl.ca.",

  body: "Dear Members of the House of Assembly in the coverage area of The Shoreline News, The Pearl News and Irish Loop Post,


I’ve just learned that the provincial government is soon abolishing the requirement in the Municipalities Act that towns advertise their public notices and tenders in their local newspapers.


This will be a serious blow to a Newfoundland industry that has already seen some dozen community newspapers across the province close in the past few years, in part because of a continuous withdrawal of advertising and support from the provincial government.

Some time back I took the trouble of checking to see how many people were actually viewing the social media ads which the provincial government places with U.S.-based social media giants and saw the numbers were terrible.


In some cases, less than 150 people had viewed particular ads and videos. By contrast, tens of thousands of Newfoundlanders see the advertisements in our community papers every week.


I am asking that you use your auspices as representatives of your constituents to oppose this change to the Municipalities Act. If it passes into legislation, it will hurt the Newfoundland and Labrador newspaper industry, the province’s pulp and paper industry, and most importantly, your constituents, as it is very likely very few of them will actually ever see the notices placed by Municipalities on websites or social media.


That, of course, would be an erosion of transparency in local government. I have copied my colleagues at The Telegram and The Northeast Avalon Times on this correspondence.

If you have any questions about our industry, please feel free to contact any one of us personally.",

  body: "Watching the American election is like watching the world’s slowest train wreck. It’s an observation I made on Twitter sometime on Wednesday evening, Nov. 4 and over a day later it was still proving accurate.


I use social media primarily for entertainment, usually my own, but the constant Donald Trump spectacle for the past four years coupled with the gong show that was my Montreal Canadiens hockey season, has been hindering a lot of the appeal lately. That all changed when the polls started coming in though.


First there were the States that Trump won, only to watch his lead dissipate, prompting the current “leader of the free world to tweet”: “We have claimed, for Electoral Vote purposes, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (which won’t allow legal observers) the State of Georgia, and the State of North Carolina, each one of which has a BIG Trump lead. Additionally, we hereby claim the State of Michigan...”


That’s not how democracy works. You can’t claim States because you don’t agree with the voters, though apparently that’s not going to stop the sitting American President from trying.


Twitter kept blocking his hot takes because not only are they factually incorrect, they are untruthful to the point of being inflammatory if not trying to incite outright violence. Trump kept at it anyway, calling for vote counting to stop in districts where he was ahead and to proceed where he was gaining ground on Democratic rival Joe Biden.


It’s madness, untethered madness demonstrated perfectly in a viral video of spiritual advisor Paula White’s impassioned prayer service.


It’s high entertainment and I will cop to feeling smug that I’m a Canadian and can enjoy it as such, but there are some potentially fatal consequences for a lot of my friends to the south.


On the day voters turned out in the greatest numbers in United States history, a staggering 93,000 new cases of COVID-19 were announced and another 1,200 American citizens died. The USA continues to lead the world in this category.


If nothing else, this election proves just how deeply divided our American neighbours are.

Protestors attempted to storm counting centres more than once. People tweeted that they voted for Trump because they fear Biden will raise their taxes, as if that excuses re-electing an impeached racist who admits he grabs women by the genitalia. Just so long as it’s not your genitalia, eh?

It’s sobering that a recent poll revealed that 12 percent of Canadians view Donald Trump favourably. I fail to understand the appeal, and I’ve had heart-to-heart conversations with people who have tried to explain it.


It usually boils down to fear mongering on some usually undisclosed level, not always racism or sexism but just worry over paying the bills. Tapping into that fear, overtly or covertly, is something a lot of American media – and to be fair even some Canadian media – has gotten quite good at because that means ratings, and ratings means money.


Someone on my feed pointed out that here in Canada, Indigenous women are still being murdered and forgotten. People are battling mental illnesses that our overwhelmed healthcare system cannot handle, sometimes with deadly outcomes.


In Quebec, there are actual language police called the Office quebecois de la langue francais (OQLF) who are actively citing restaurants for English infractions even though the food establishments aren’t even open because of the pandemic. There existed, at one point, an instagram page called White Power Newfoundland. 


The spectacle I smack-talked on Twitter now seems as infectious and as deadly as COVID-19. Two days after the election began, my self-righteous Canadian smugness is gone.

The American election isn’t reality entertainment, it’s a gut check.",

  subtitles: "Deputy Mayor and Deputy Fire Chief Todd Strickland is the new President of the Port aux Basques & Area Chamber of Commerce. - © J. René Roy / Wreckhouse Press Inc.",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The Port aux Basques and Area Chamber of Commerce has a new President. Todd Strickland, who also serves as the town’s Deputy Mayor and is the Deputy Fire Chief for the Channel-Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department, was voted in by acclimation.


“I truly wish that somebody from the business community had stepped forward, but unfortunately this time it didn’t happen,” says Strickland. “It feels pretty good. No doubt about it.”


Strickland likes the idea of serving as the liaison for both the Town and the Chamber, and hopes to get more businesses to sign on as members. His goal as the new President is to help local businesses grow and move forward.


This is Strickland’s first time stepping into the role of President, although he has been a member of the Chamber for the past seven years. He has also previously served as the Chamber’s Vice-President.


“We’re kind of out of sorts with how we do our AGM (Annual General Meeting) business,” admits Strickland. “I’m not sure if it’s because of COVID that some of our business community didn’t come together and participate. If it is the reason, that’s very unfortunate.”


The Chamber itself got sidelined during the pandemic. Its sole full-time employee was on vacation when the first wave struck, and Strickland says they had hoped initially to keep her working from home. By closing the train museum to the public, she was able to work as normal but then the province began ordering businesses to shut down.


“A few weeks down the road there was just not that much for her to do,” says Strickland. “Really we did shut down for approximately three months.”


The Chamber did send their employee as their representative to the the Southwestern COVID Action Committee, and she kept the board and members in the loop with information coming from those meetings. Serving as Vice-President and part of the COVID committee, Strickland did what he could to try to keep members informed during the shutdown.


“The big thing with the Chamber is having people involved,” says Strickland. “Unfortunately we probably only have one-third or so, approximately one-third, of the businesses in the Port aux Basques and surrounding areas that are Chamber members so I would like to see that grow.”


Now that the Chamber is back into full swing, in addition to growing its membership it is focusing on programs like Linkages, which helps connect youth with job opportunities within the community. Strickland isn’t sure how many years the Chamber has been helming the Linkages program but says it has always been a huge success and allows youth to get some job experience and references while helping businesses fill temporary staffing needs.


To attract more new members, Strickland says he is focused on finding ways to provide more services that the Chamber can offer to the business community, what development grants and supports are already in place such as the Linkages program, and the benefits of professional networking.


One of the Chamber’s more successful networking events is the annual Business Expo. That had to be cancelled due to COVID and the resulting economic down.


“When we have some of our major players that can’t attend the Expo it kind of has a snowball effect,” observes Strickland. “If we can revitalize that, depending on the rules, regulations, permissions with the COVID, we will definitely have a look at it again. It’s going to depend on our major vendors; as long as they’re on side.”


Strickland says there is strength in numbers and even casual, informal networking can provide insight that may help a fellow entrepreneur solve a problem. Networking with the public to help promote local business is another area Strickland has identified as problematic.


“Being a small community, being a small town, buying local isn’t always possible and I totally understand that,” says Strickland. “If we keep the money in town, spend the dollars in town, I think it’s so much better for all of the business community, so much better for all of the townspeople, better for all of the Southwest Coast.”


He points out that it’s understandable that people want to save money, especially on larger purchases, by shopping in Corner Brook or St. John’s. He sometimes can’t get what he wants locally, but when he can choose that option he makes a conscious decision to support a local business instead. He believes that some consumers may simply be unaware there is a local business offering a similar product, and that’s where the Chamber can help businesses get the word out.


“If it’s not on the shelf here, maybe it can be brought in,” says Strickland, noting that travelling to urban areas requires more time, food and gas. “Buying local might be cheaper if you look at it in the grand scheme of things.”


Currently only five of the Chamber’s nine board seats are filled, but Strickland says three businesses are interested in joining and believes more will follow. Anyone interested in learning more about the Chamber can reach out via their website or Facebook page, or contact Cheryl Dingwell at (709) 695-3688 or via email at pabchamber@nf.aibn.com. 


“There were some great people at the helm before myself and I just want to see that continue,” says Strickland. “Hopefully make the Chamber bigger and better than it ever was.”",

  body: "Town council is exploring ways to better enforce municipal bylaws. Here are some more details on that issues and other matters from the most recent meeting of council, held at the fire hall on Monday, Nov. 9th.


Matthews Lane

A delegation of residents living on Matthews Lane asked council to once again vote to take ownership of the road, pave it and commit to snow clearing. All of council would like to honour the request, but Mayor John Spencer told the delegates that things must be done properly as advised by the town’s legal representatives, and will take some time. The Mayor believes that there will be room in the 2021 budget to have the surveys done. The road is unlikely to get paved this year, but the town has committed to take care of the snow clearing. Council noted that the estimate for paving the road is high and will examine ways to offset the expense, such as the gas tax fund or through Municipal Capital Works.


Municipal enforcement

Deputy Mayor Todd Strickland noted that vendors are still parking across from the hospital on weekends. Town clerk Julia Ingram said that the town does not have staff working on weekends to ask them to move to the designated farmer’s market area in front of the Train Museum, which in turn prompted discussion about the possibility of having a municipal enforcement officer.

Mayor Spencer wondered if the dog catcher’s duties can be expanded to include enforcement of municipal bylaws, which is something that Stephenville did.

“Community policing came up at MNL this weekend,” said Spencer. “Of all the 300 towns in this province, very few of us have the budget for it.”

The mayor went on to say that Port aux Basques is one of the larger towns in this province. Some towns share the expense of an enforcement officer and Strickland asked if perhaps the neighbouring towns in the area would consider that. Ingram informed council that this had been attempted in the past without success due to limited budgets.

“It’s very difficult without regional government to get a lot of things done. This would be one of the big advantages of a regional form of government,” said Spencer. “Being a small municipality we have very little voice.”

Spencer believes that the cost of the enforcement officer would be paid for in permits alone. The town did use students in the past to enforce permit compliance for construction and may revisit that idea as well. Parking enforcement is also among Council’s concerns when it comes to bylaw enforcement.


Correspondence

Go Western Newfoundland (GWN) has wrote a letter to Council asking for $1,000. Julia Ingram stated that in the past, the membership fee was $50 per year but no invoice has been received since 2018. Council used to advertise in their magazine as well, but not for that amount. The town is also a member of Tourism Southwest, and Economic Development Officer Shauna Strickland is a member of that committee. The request will be sent to the Economic Development Committee for review prior to making a decision.

Council is looking at possibly purchasing the land at 88 Main Street. Not only will it facilitate snow clearing, but Mayor Spencer said, “That would be a great idea for senior housing if we ever get that funding.”


Newspaper advertising

In its Nov. 9 edition, Wreckhouse Weekly published a letter seeking support to oppose the provincial government’s proposal to halt mandatory advertising in community newspapers throughout the province.

Coun. Jim Lane expressed worry over government transparency and accountability should the motion pass. Town Manager Leon MacIsaac observed that delays with the town’s new municipal plan were a result of not advertising effectively enough, and doesn’t understand why the government would even consider such a proposal.

Clerk Julia Ingram concurred, sharing that proper advertising has even been proven relevant in court cases.

“Just assuming people look at Facebook is the wrong assumption to make,” said Spencer. “I see it in the same vein as if the government announced tomorrow that they were going to cancel the Newfoundland Gazette.”

Coun. Melvin Keeping clarified that the town could continue to advertise proposals for tenders and other official matters even if the act does pass. Council intends to send a letter to MNL opposing this change to the province’s Municipal Act.


Weigh scales

During council’s recent visit to St. John’s, the matter of the provincial weigh scales being closed during peak hours was raised. Coun. Keeping said that after speaking with the minister, he learned that there were some issues related to staffing. Council has been concerned at the loss of possible revenue because the scales are often closed during the ferry offload.

Mayor Spencer stated that on Nov. 1 he passed the scales sometime before noon only to watch trucks roll past.

“There was nothing open. A tractor trailer, with a load of lumber – it looked like the top of it had shifted – going through at the same time. It brought back all kinds of horrible memories about an accident we had quite a few years ago,” said Spencer, who then wondered if drivers were waiting until the scales closed to pass by the area unchallenged. “It needs to be open for safety reasons.”

Coun. Keeping says he will follow up with provincial officials, including MHA Andrew Parsons, to see what progress is being made with regards to staffing and keeping the scales open more often.",

Maintenance

The town only has one new pump left. A supplier quote for six new pumps priced them at $22,425 that council hopes to purchase using Gas Tax funds.

Meanwhile a tendered bid of $500 for a chlorination system was rejected by council. They will advise the bidder of the ideal price range and re-advertise the tender in a PMA bulletin.

The town will also contact MNL to get new winter tires for the truck, and the town clerk will get quotes for a new spreader to be included in the 2021 town budget.

The salt shed is in dire need of repair or replacement, which Council hopes to fund through the Capital Works program.

The town also wants to get new signs with the town logo for the Town Hall building and the Fire Department.

  body: "SOUTHWEST COAST – Port aux Basques will not be holding its annual Santa Claus parade thanks to the pandemic. The COVID-19 Advisory Committee, the Channel-Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department and the Town Council have all agreed that it is better to err on the side of caution this year.


“Anything that would be a magnet that would attract people would not be what we want,” said Mayor John Spencer during the Nov. 9 meeting of council. “Even talking about driving the fire truck around town, it still becomes a magnet for bringing people into town.”


If the Fire Department carries Santa and Mrs. Claus around on a fire truck, Coun. Jim Lane observed that the truck wouldn’t be able to cover every single side street and some residents may have to head down to the main roads to watch, so guidelines on public gatherings must be taken into account.


“Santa Claus will make a visit through town before Christmas,” promised Fire Chief Jerry Musseau in a phone interview late last week.


One of the other suggestions the Fire Department has also proposed is a home decorating contest, complete with first, second and third place winners who will all receive prizes. The town has held such a contest in past years called Light Up Your Community, and this new one will likely run along a similar vein, with dates announced for judging and the winning entries published in the newspaper.


Details on how Santa will make his annual visit along with the dates for the judging of the as yet unnamed decorating contest will be announced in the very near future.


Meanwhile, Coun. Melvin Keeping always decorates his home each Christmas and plans to do so again this year, but he has already been declared ineligible to win a prize.


“All councillors are not qualified,” joked Spencer.


Codroy Valley, the Town of Rose Blanche-Harbour Le Cou and the Town of Burnt Islands have yet to make a decision regarding their annual Christmas parade. The Town of Isle aux Morts did not respond to inquiries prior to publication deadline.",

  body: "STEPHENVILLE – A group of volunteers are working hard to try to develop a driving track for racing enthusiasts in Stephenville. Local business owner Scott Simms, with an assist from his father Gary, is part of the group developing Western Speed Park.


“We’re still in the middle of forming our committee, getting it all set up,” says Scott. “It’s going to be a speed park so whatever form of racing we can do, we will do.”


Scott also foresees competitions being held for go-kart racing, drag racing, eighth-mile racing, snowmobile racing and more. Even though everything is not yet set up, the park has already held two autocross events in October. The first one alone drew 17 participants.


Autocross is an individual race around a timed, pre-determined course. The group redesigns the layout of the course after every event to keep things fresh and challenging.


“This is all going to come with time, but right now our problem is asphalt. The asphalt that is there has been there since the fifties. It’s eroding pretty bad to the point where it’s unusable when you’re drag racing,” notes Scott. “The only thing that was usable was the autocross. We were able to go around the bad spots on the asphalt with our pylon course.”


There used to be a speed park in Stephenville once before that Scott believes closed around 1994. Three years ago he began to germinate ideas to start up a new park, which he has got around to actively pursuing this past year.


“You know there was a lot of things that had to happen,” he says. “Now that we have insurance put in place and a permit, we’re able to actively race on there in a way where it’s co-ordinated, and in a way where it’s as safe as possible, and every effort is put in to keeping it as professional as possible.”


Once the committee is finalized, Scott hopes to form a club to deal with the asphalt problem and then move on to testing, among other tasks. The goal is to make the speed park races a regular, weekend event for racers and fans to enjoy.


“We’re going to have to find money. I don’t know how much it’s going to cost yet. We’ve never even really gotten quotes. I can imagine it’s going to be into the hundreds of thousands of dollars,” says Scott. “But aside from that everything is basically already there.”


The site has guardrails, fencing, and most of the safety lines and distancing markers from the previous speed park. Scott says having those already in place makes for a good head start, and will help further rejuvenate the industrial side of the town. Carolina Avenue, which runs parallel to the speed park, has been recently repaved.


“We need bleachers,” says Scott. “We need to make spectator areas where it’s safe.”


Some of the existing fencing still needs repair and Scott says there will likely have to be some snow fencing installed to mitigate wind conditions during snowmobile races. He doesn’t think the remaining obstacles are insurmountable.


“With enough determination and volunteer work, we should be able to at least get something there with regards to snowmobile racing, because right now it’s another obstacle,” says Scott. “There’s lots of things to do in the summer when the weather’s good, but what do you do for the six months of the year when the weather is not good?”


So far it seems determination and volunteer work are plentiful. Scott credits the Town of Stephenville, the business community, racers and even the public for jumping in to help get the Western Speed Park up and running.


“At one point, for cleaning it up, we cleaned the whole area down there for the drag strip in the matter of a weekend. It was incredible. We had plow trucks coming in from everywhere, knocking off the grub from the pavement that was there for 50 plus years. We had sweepers down there – I mean people down there with brooms – and town trucks. It was crazy!”


Scott promises there will be events coming in the summer of 2021, and hopes to put down new asphalt next August if enough money can be found. But it’s hard to commit to a timeline yet because there still remains many unknowns.


“We do have people standing by and they’re ready to organize a snowmobile event,” promises Scott. “We’re doing everything we can to get it going as soon as we can.”

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Pandemic fatigue is not only very real but increasingly worrisome as it serves to undermine established protocols to protect against the virus. With an increasing number of COVID-19 related cases being reported across the country and within the Atlantic bubble, the challenge grows for government to balance the conflicting need for socialization and economic recovery.


On a municipal level, Economic Development officer Shauna Strickland is trying to get creative to help people stay connected but safe, especially as the holiday season rapidly approaches. To do that, she is trying to bring together local musicians for an online concert.


“It has been a rough year and so many events and projects had to be cancelled. With the Christmas season upon us I thought it would be some much needed cheer to get our local musicians together and entertain the community,” wrote Strickland via e-mail.


The concert is intended to last through 10 nights, tentatively scheduled for Nov. 23 to 27, and from Nov. 30 to Dec. 4 from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. The concerts will be livestreamed free via the Bruce Arena Facebook page.


Musicians from around the region are being asked to participate, and each musician will be granted a small stipend of $100 for two hours of concert time, capped at $500 per band.


“I brought the idea forward to the historical society board and it was supported through our grant for Astrolabe Days through the Canadian Heritage,” stated Strickland. 


The bands are not restricted when it comes to musical offerings either. Strickland notes that each will bring their own style of music and they won’t be asked to change that. She does hope, however, that some will offer up a few Christmas songs to spread some cheer.


“It’s been a different year and not being able to bring the community together to celebrate events such as Astrolabe Days, Canada Day, Municipal Awareness day and other annual events has made me realize just how important those activities are in keeping the community together and community spirit high,” wrote Strickland. “I hope this project brings some joy to the homes of our residents.",

  body: "Dear editor,


My 19 year old daughter, Jasmin, lost her life tragically in a motor vehicle collision back on March 25, 2019. She became a Type 1 diabetic at the age of 15 years old. 


Since Jasmin’s passing, I have done several things in her memory to express to people just how loved she was and to help me deal with her loss. I also wanted to build her legacy so she will never be forgotten. 


In June 2019 I started the first JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) Sun Life Walk for diabetes in the local area. This specific walk was called The Walk for Jasmin. It was to help raise funds for Type 1 diabetes research for the JDRF. In the last two years, we have raised over $10,000. The support from the local community has been phenomenal.

I then decided to start a new project called Project Jasmin. This is a project to spread hope and positivity to young teens who are struggling with any type of issues, whether it be mental or physical.


I have seen Jasmin struggle many times since she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She was very athletic and outgoing and her life had to change drastically since she became a diabetic. Her whole lifestyle had to change.


As she was in a few divisions in minor hockey, she had to stop between periods during a game to test her sugar. She had to watch what she ate and at what times she ate. She used a different classroom that was set up in St. James high school because she would need extra time to do her test because of her diabetes.


Most times, any stress or illness would mean sugar levels fluctuating and would often result in her being in the hospital for a few days. Diabetes is not to be taken lightly and can mentally and physically take a toll on a young teen. This is why I thought of Project Jasmin.


For 2020, I have done a small fundraiser to help with the project. I first sold these keychains that says, “You are worth it!” The letter T in worth is the Celtic symbol for strength. This is to remind everyone that they are worth it and even though they are struggling, there’s always hope and positivity.


The support from selling the keychains was amazing. Now I have also started making a Christmas ornament in honour of Project Jasmin. These are only small fundraisers but have had a huge success. For 2020 there are four mini-projects in place.


One has been given out to a student originally from the Codroy Valley area, another will be given to a student in St. James Regional High School, another in Grandy’s River school, and another one has been given to a student in the St. John’s area, whose family is originally from Isle aux Morts.


These names are not made public yet as they are waiting to receive the Project Jasmin Memorial gift. To each recipient they are given a keepsake from Project Jasmin to remind them to stay positive, always have hope no matter how hard it gets, and for them to know that they are always loved.


Thank you!",

I’ve been looking at your article about the underground structure in front of Ideal Convenience (Accidental Archaeology, Nov. 2).


On that exact location was a barbershop owned by one Eric Hulan and it did have a basement. I was in it a few times. After him the shop was taken over by Isaac Sheaves, then Russell Anderson, and then John Warren.


Where the Auto Parts is now was previously the Bank of Montreal and prior to that there was a store owned by Mr. Lew Davis, and following that it was owned by Mr. Nathan Bragg as a restaurant.


Close to that and what is part of the now Ideal Convenience was a house owned by Mr. Frank Brake and the other part of Ideal Convenience was the Hulan barbershop.


Then where Don Allen is now was a house and shop combination owned by Mr. Max Strickland, and next to that was Mr. Ray Davis where Barry Musseau is now.


Hope this clears up a few things. I remember the location quite well as I travelled it every day of my life as a younger person.",

  body: "Living on an island can be fantastic. There are unfettered views of the ocean. There are plenty of secluded rivers and sandy beaches. But living on an island can be a colossal pain in the butt as well. 


We can easily be cut off from the mainland by inclement weather, or have some very intense winds that build strength over the water and hit us like a freight train.  But perhaps the most frustrating thing about living here is groceries. 


During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw the effects of supply being outweighed by demand Most store shelves from here to Deer Lake were empty, and with the travel restrictions that were put in place, supply was severely impacted. 


Now that things have settled down and supply chains have return to a semblance of normal, we should be fine when it comes to getting what we want. But that is not the whole story. 


Admittedly, I don’t do a lot of the grocery shopping in my household, but when I do go I am astounded at the the prices. A whopping $37 for half of a ham seems like insanity to me. Paying over 5 dollars for a 2L of milk, when the same item can be bought anywhere in Nova Scotia for 3 is disheartening, especially when you consider there’s a large dairy farm operation in the region. 


I understand that transporting foodstuffs to the island can increase the price of items, but I also feel that if we are going to be paying outrageous prices for our food, there is no valid reason for my purchases to be wilted, spoiled, old, or already at the expiry date. 


There has been much talk of a road between Newfoundland and the mainland, but driving 16 extra hours through northern Québec when the ferry gets tied up because of bad weather doesn’t mean prices will be cheaper, it just means food will be more spoiled. 


I know there is no easy solution. I know that i will have to continue paying $300 for a week’s worth of groceries. I know that my fruits and vegetables will always be in the stores at the end of their best before date. 


I don’t like it any more than you do. But I know theres very little I can do to fix it.

  body: "Professional drummer Chuck D. Keeping of Big Wreck has plenty of fond memories of his small town Newfoundland roots to share.


The versatile musician has over 28 years of experience, has toured internationally and has recorded with an impressive list of award winning artists like Suzie McNeil and Jeff Healey. He’s jammed with Prince, worked with members of the Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart, and Bon Jovi among countless other high profile musicians. He’s opened for too many others to count, including Aerosmith, Motley Crue and Alan Jackson.


He’s been nominated for five Junos and three Maple Blues awards, and won Road Gold and CMW Indie awards. He’s gotten used to big names, big cities and bright lights.


Despite that, the affable musician is more than happy to chat about growing up in Port aux Basques in a family gifted with love and talent for music.


“Our whole family is fairly musical, especially on my Mom’s side, so it was always guitars kicking around the house, and my Dad used to play in local bands and whatnot,” shares Keeping via telephone from his home in Toronto.


As the bands rehearsed in his parents’ basement, it was only natural for a young Keeping to pick up a guitar. He had peers and classmates who played pool halls on weekends or at teenage dances, so he grew up surrounded by music seemingly everywhere.


“I don’t know why I stuck with drums. I actually started on guitar, but it seemed like everybody was playing guitar so I thought hey, if I play drums maybe I could actually play more,” says Keeping, who picks AC/DC as one of top his musical influences.


When his father noticed that he was getting serious about it, the two formed their own band called 21 LeGrow, which was actually their street address at the time. They began playing pubs up and down the Southwest coast, in Corner Brook or all the way up to St. Anthony or down to Burgeo, and even as far east as Clarenville.


Keeping had no formal training in music but he had a musical ear and would learn songs through trial and error, listening repeatedly to a piece until he learned to replicate it. Local drummer Max Piercey gave him his first real lesson one day at the Port Club before a practice session.


“One of the bands my Dad was in, Max was drumming at the time,” remembers Keeping. “He basically just made sure that I understood what I was doing. I was playing but I didn’t know what I was doing, so he just kind of put everything into perspective and gave me a goal.”


It was the only lesson Piercey ever gave him, but it was enough to help grow Keeping’s confidence and reveal he was on the right track. Keeping says Piercey’s single lesson, which included tips on what to do and what not to do, was enough to give him a solid head start.

“He was the first guy to sit down and actually show me some things,” says Keeping.


After high school, Keeping decided to relocate to see if he could actually make a career out of music. He was 17 when he moved to London, Ontario, where he took a year long course in music production and engineering. That allowed him to network, play in open-stage jams and become familiar with the music scene and the industry.


One his studies were completed, he started playing gigs with some of the musicians he had met. He was still young, only 18, and seasoned musicians took him under their wing. He found himself filling in when more seasoned drummers were unavailable to play, and eventually he became the first drummer that artists would turn to if they needed a freelance to fill in.


“I’ve only ever been in two bands my whole life outside of high school. Everything I’ve done over these last 30-something years has been for hire,” says Keeping. 


Artists like Ron Hynes, for example, might have different musicians played each tour, or at least in different countries to avoid visa hassles or exorbitant work permit fees. Keeping has spent much of his drumming career rotating through musical gigs, and even as a member of Big Wreck he still freelances when he can.


The first band he was in was Fathead, an R&B/Blues/Soul band based out of Toronto that had won Junos and toured with B.B. King. Keeping was in his early 20s then, and he joined Fathead when they were auditioning for new drummers. He got the gig largely because he was the only drummer who came to the audition fully prepared.


“I thought there’s no way they’re going to hire me. I’m too young. It’s not going to fit,” recalls Keeping.


A few days later he got the call.


“I found out later that the reason why I got the gig was because I was the only guy that actually showed up who knew the songs.”


That meant moving from London to Toronto so he could make the weekly practice schedule. That presented more problems. Toronto is an expensive city to live in, so Keeping sold his primary drum kit and kept his backup so he could make his first and last month’s rent.


After joining the band he toured North America and in the company of legendary performers like James Brown. He played drums on one of Fathead’s Juno-nominated albums.


“They really taught me a lot,” notes Keeping.


He parted ways with Fathead when producers with Sony Records kept calling from the Toronto office. Freelancing for Sony conflicted with the band’s schedule, but Keeping’s bandmates gave him plenty of support, and told him he was still young and needed to seize these opportunities.


“I freelanced again for another 10, 12, 14 years –whatever it was – playing with all kinds of different people and then Big Wreck.”


Big Wreck was auditioning for a new drummer and Keeping tried out but didn’t land the gig initially. He was one of two called back for a second audition but the band initially chose the other drummer.


“When I was in high school they were one of my favourite bands, because they started in the mid-90s,” shares Keeping. “I get a call. I think it was 11 o’clock at night on a weekday in the middle of winter.”


The band’s road manager asked Keeping to drop everything and head out on a six a.m. flight to play the next evening’s sold out show and then go on to finish the tour. At the time, Keeping was doing some television work that he had lined up for the next couple of weeks.


“When I auditioned I only had to learn five songs, only had to play five songs, but now all of a sudden I’ve got to do a two hour show with these guys,” he recalls thinking. “The music is fairly detailed, so I basically stayed up all night and just learned just as much I could. I got no sleep. I had no clothes. I wasn’t prepared. It was winter, just pack a suitcase and go for two or three weeks, whatever it was.”


Even on the plane he kept trying to learn, and the band received permission to have extra time during the sound check to run through each song once. That’s as much preparation as Keeping got before going on stage that evening with Big Wreck.


After the tour, Keeping arrived home shortly before Christmas and didn’t hear anything more for a couple of months until he got an e-mail telling him about a band photo shoot.


“I remember thinking, ‘Do I show up?’ Nobody told me I’m in the band. I don’t want to be that guy that shows up and then there’s another guy there. What do I do? And I didn’t feel like asking, ‘Should I show up?’ So I decided to show up anyway and we did this photo shoot and two or three days later I got an e-mail that we’re not using any of those photos. I thought ‘Oh no! I wasn’t supposed to be there’,” shares Keeping.


He kept getting e-mails though so he kept showing up to places until finally his band mates asked if he was even happy to have the gig because he was so quiet and kept to himself so much. That’s when he finally realized he was officially a member of Big Wreck.


“We decided like three shows in that you were going to be the new guy,” Keeping recalls them telling him. “I guess the manager was supposed to make the call but he thought somebody else in the band was. The call never got made.”


Nine or ten years later Big Wreck is still going strong and Keeping still finds the music fresh and challenging as they record new music. Although touring is impossible because of COVID-19, the band has found a way to perform live in front of fans by using an airfield to host drive in concerts. Eventually when the pandemic ends, he hopes to tour North America and even Europe.


Their fans remain in cars to enjoy the live music, and like to honk and flash their headlights after songs to show their appreciation. It was a little strange at first, admits Keeping, but it has nonetheless proven popular and gotten rave reviews. Despite the cold winter, there’s even some chatter about the possibility of a New Year’s show.


When his Big Wreck schedule permits, Keeping likes to keep busy freelancing. He also offers private, individual drumming lessons online. He likes his students to stay focused, regardless of whether they are children or adults. (chuckdkeepinglessons@gmail.com) 


Keeping had intended to visit friends and family for Port aux Basques Come Home Year 2020. He has a two and a half year old son who has visited twice before the pandemic shut everything down. They didn’t make it home this year and the celebration, which was postponed, may not even happen in 2021 as long as COVID-19 continues to pose a risk.


“Once a year I usually try to get home for about a week,” says Keeping. “It’s gonna be a while. It’s still getting worse. We’re not headed in the right direction.”


The good news is that Chuck Keeping and Big Wreck most definitely are.",

  subtitles: "John Wright plans to open a pottery business at his summer home in Rose Blanche, N.L.",
  body: "ROSE BLANCHE - HARBOUR LE COU – In August 2019, shortly prior to the Writers at Woody Point Festival, John and Jane Wright found themselves exploring the west coast of Newfoundland. The pair had visited years before and fell in love with the province, but back then they still lived and worked just south of Vancouver, British Columbia and toyed with the idea of buying a summer home. But they didn’t proceed with the idea.


Last summer they returned and spent a few days exploring the Southwest coast while staying at the Lightkeepers Inn B&B. The couple were enchanted by the scenery, the residents and even the weather.


“One afternoon we were out walking and came across a ‘For Sale’ sign on a blue house on Big Bottom Road. The owner happened to be on site and gave us a five minute tour of the house,” wrote John Wright via e-mail.


The Wrights toyed with the idea while at the concert, and over a beer in a Woody Point pub just a few days before they were scheduled to fly home, decided to buy the house.


“We returned to Rose Blanche in October 2019 to see exactly what it was we had bought and came away confident we had indeed made the right decision,” said John.


Along with the house, the Wrights had purchased a decent sized shed, wired and close to the road for easy access. Right away John started toying with the idea of building a pottery studio. He’s been a potter for going on five decades now, and knew he would want to continue pottery throwing (the act of making pottery) during summers at their new home.


“There is some artistic history in Rose Blanche,” noted John. “The well-known Canadian painter Horace Champagne once had a summer residence in the village and there is a glass artist out on Parson’s Point.”


The couple hadn’t noticed a lot of pottery during their West coast visit, and opening up a small studio to create and sell pottery seemed a great way for John and Jane to immerse themselves in the area.


“Planning the studio began to occupy my mind over last winter,” wrote John. “This year, we were able to come to Newfoundland because of owning property there, as well as having Newfoundland drivers’ licenses and owning a car in the province. We had to isolate for the first two weeks but that was okay. It’s a really lovely place to hang out anyway.”


During their trip this summer, John located a used kiln for sale in Bunyan’s Cove and the couple drove up to get it. This winter he intends to locate a potter’s wheel, some clay and other tools and supplies to complete the setup of his studio, which he plans to call Shed Pottery, when they return in May 2021. He also plans to ship down some of the wares he’s crafting in the meantime so that he can open the studio to visitors.


He has a selection of mugs, bowls, teapots, butter dishes and other useful pieces, as well as decorative houses and ceramic fish. He also plans on doing more pottery throwing in his new studio to add to that inventory.


“Lately I have been making a series of ceramic houses inspired by the homes I see in Newfoundland,” said John.


Although John has been teaching pottery for over 20 years, his Shed Pottery studio will be too small to offer classes.


“I will be happy to welcome people into the studio to observe the magic of this craft. I hope to meet you at Shed Pottery, 54 Big Bottom Road, Rose Blanche during Summer 2021,” wrote John.

Lawrence, who has no prior criminal record, cited a great deal of stress as a factor. He also told the court that he has lost someone to drunk driving in the past and showed remorse during his apology.

  subtitles: "From left: Avery, MacKenzie and Hannah Chant are mourning the loss of their beloved cat, Smokey.",
  body: "MACDOUGALLS – Family members are feeling grief and confusion after their beloved pet cat, Smokey, had to be euthanized because it had been shot, likely on Friday evening, Nov. 13.


MacKenzie Chant, 18, says that some of the family had chosen to spend an evening at their retreat in MacDougalls to enjoy the unusually warm weather and Smokey was used to accompanying them there. Although they try to keep the cat inside, he does get out and he got out that night around suppertime.


Not long afterwards Tara, Mackenzie’s stepmother, heard gunshots but thought little of it since rabbit hunting is commonplace in the area. Although the cat was a family pet, he was particularly attached to Tara.


“He didn’t come back like he normally does. He always comes back,” says MacKenzie. “That night he still hadn’t come back. She was out calling for him, put his food and litter by the door, but he didn’t come back.”


By the next morning Smokey still hadn’t come home and MacKenzie hopped in the car with her boyfriend and little sister Avery, 4, to head to up to MacDougalls and help search. They plunged into the thick woods near the cabin while calling for Smokey, but to no avail.

“He has a collar on with a bell, so you could always hear him coming,” says MacKenzie. “That’s when I found rabbit snares so I started to get really worried that he was caught in one.”


Tara then took a turn walking up and down the road calling for the cat while MacKenzie stayed with Avery. After still no sign of Smokey, the family began packing up to return home. They had work commitments and other obligations, but relatives would keep an eye on the cabin and check every half hour in case Smokey returned. Tara started to put MacKenzie’s dog in the truck and that’s when she heard a loud meow coming from nearby, between their cabin and the neighbour’s next to a small pump house.


“She found him led there, bleeding, so she picked him up and ran him back to the cabin,” recounts MacKenzie.


The family used a wet rag to gently clean the blood off the cat, who led on the sofa without moving. Although Smokey was being co-operative, they soon noticed something wasn’t quite right.


“He didn’t make any noise. He was very alert, but he had his right paw kind of tucked up under him, but we were touching it and squeezing it but he wasn’t meowing. He wasn’t in pain from it but he couldn’t move it on his own.” 


On Saturday morning they took Smokey to MaczKenie’s mother’s house. She’s a dedicated volunteer with a local cat rescue group with a lot of experience with cats, and that’s when they got a good look at the hole in Smokey’s shoulder.


“It was kind of in his upper shoulder blade, right on his neck, and it was just a deep, deep hole and it looked like there was something white in it,” says MacKenzie.


Not knowing how severe the injury was, and fearing the white object was a piece of bone or wood, Smokey was taken home to Tara’s and kept comfortable. He was given some medication to prevent infection and Tara managed to prompt him to drink a bit of water, but the cat refused to eat. Tara reached out to friends Loretta and Eugene Battiste in the Codroy Valley, who are experienced cat rescuers, and on Sunday morning transported him up to the Battistes.

“We would have brought him in on the weekend if we could,” admits MacKenzie. “It’s like $500 I think just to walk in the door.”

The harsh reality for pet owners is that rushing an injured animal to a vet on the weekend is prohibitively expensive, assuming emergency care is even available. On Monday morning, Nov. 16, the Battistes took Smokey in to the vet who ran tests and x-rays that showed the young cat’s shoulder had been completely shattered. That came as no surprise to the Chant family, who had expected that was likely the case, and by then had decided to go ahead with an emergency leg amputation if necessary.


“But the bullet also shattered and travelled down into his stomach,” says MacKenzie. “It travelled down into his internal organs.”


There was nothing that could be done to save Smokey, so Tara and Avery held and stroked their little cat as the veterinarian ended his suffering.


“We just figured it was a pellet gun,” says MacKenzie. “They said it was more than that, like a small hunting rifle.”


MacKenzie is hoping that it was an accident, but isn’t entirely convinced that was the case. Cats and rabbits move differently, and rabbit hunters tend to claim their prey, not leave it there without checking on it. In addition, Smokey was wearing a bell collar with his name and a contact number on it. The collar was missing by the time Tara found him. MacKenzie notes that the collar was left loose in case he got snagged on a branch so that he could squirm out if that happened.


If it was an accident, why has no one stepped forward to claim responsibility and apologize? At least then, says MacKenzie, the family would have some answers and some closure, and wouldn’t be left to worry this might happen to someone else’s pet. She says that not knowing is only making things harder.


“He’s been up there all summer, going outside. Everyone knew him. He was loved on that road,” says MacKenzie.


Even though she’s heard other troubling stories, MacKenzie is unsure if the family will reach out to the RCMP. Tara is devastated and Avery is a bit too young to understand that Smokey is never coming home. Her voice catches as she chokes back tears while talking about them playing together.


“It’s so scary. We never thought this would happen to him.”",

The very fact that we have our own newspaper for the area and not something that is going to focus mainly on everything except local content is a plus for all of us. Naturally some content is needed from outside the local area – that is what news and information is all about – as long as outside stories do not dominate the paper.


I have to say, I like very much what I have seen so far and I urge people to become involved, especially in areas of things that have happened in the past. The content and picture quality is very impressive. It reminds me of the time when the Gulf News was “THE GULF NEWS”, that belonged to the town and the area.

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – It's easy to hear the happiness in Lt. Maurice Collins’ voice these days. As an officer with the Salvation Army, he is excited about the new provincial program that began on Monday, Nov 16 that allows hunters in Newfoundland and Labrador to now donate moose meat to their local food banks. 


“We have been hoping for this. If people have extra moose meat and they wanted to give it to somebody, but didn’t have anyone to give it to, well here’s an opportunity now to help the needy in your community,” says Collins.


Contrary to popular belief, Newfoundland and Labrador food banks were always allowed to accept moose meat. But before it could be distributed it had to be cooked as per provincial government regulations.


“So now this allows us to give out moose meat to clients and they can cook it themselves,” shared Collins.


Donating moose meat has long been sought after by food banks, especially since protein donations being among the hardest to get. In September, the government of Newfoundland and Labrador accepted a proposal to allow donations to begin. 


“We are hoping to get some donations soon,” says Collins. “There are a few criteria that have to be followed . I can’t accept a moose and package or ground it up myself.”


It is asked that all donations of the moose meat are properly packaged by a government approved butcher in one pound packages, and preferably frozen prior to delivery. Tag numbers and personal information will be given in order to ensure the hunter has a license for the meat he or she is donating. 


Since October, the demand on the Port aux Basques food bank has continued to skyrocket. Normally it services around 60 to 70 families in the Southwest coast region, but that has almost doubled.


Says Collins, “It’s picking up dramatically.”


Anyone wishing to donate a portion of their moose to the local Salvation Army Food Bank can call (709) 695-5803 or visit the program’s official website for directions on how to prepare donations at www.sharingtheharvestnl.ca.",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Vivian Chaulk has been knitting and sewing most of her life. It’s a skill and art form she developed when she was still a young girl.


“I think we all learned to knit when we were at home – teenagers,” says Vivian. “I usually knit every day but I sew off and on.”


When she does sew, she’s usually at work on a colourful quilt. It’s a process that can take a few months and requires a detailed pattern.


“I took quilting classes for two years from Alice Keeping. She was a really good teacher, and I probably wasn’t too bad a student,” laughs Vivian.


Once she finishes a quilt, Vivian usually gifts it to her family members. She’ll also sell them on occasion, usually for an amount between $300 to $400.


Vivian estimates she’s made about 30 to 35 quilts over the years, if not more.

When she knits it’s usually socks and mitts, including the trigger finger mitts. She’ll gift those too, and sell still more at the craft store in the Codroy Valley.


That didn’t happen this summer thanks to COVID-19.


“They do get a lot of tourists up in the Valley but this COVID has turned everything bottom up,” says Vivian.


That lack of tourists to buy her crafts hasn’t really slowed Vivian down any. She’s sold what she made over the summer to folks around town instead. Her mitts usually sell for $20.

Naturally this close to the holidays she’s working on her own Christmas list.


“Most of my nieces like the homemade wool, or I should say sheep’s wool for socks. They like to wear them around the house,” says Vivian. “I’ve got to make them a pair for Christmas.”


Vivian’s kind of backed up for Christmas orders these days. People keep calling to see if she can whip them up a pair of socks or mitts to hand out as holiday gifts.


“I don’t have that many made because I hadn’t bothered this summer because the craft store wasn’t open,” admits Vivian.


She’s not sure she can fill them all in time.


“I’ll tell them I’ll do what I can.”


When she’s not working on her crafts, Vivian goes out on the bus once a week for a ride down to the United Church hall.


She plays cards with a few others. They like to play 10 games of 120 when they get together and there’s a usually small prize for the winner.


“And no cheating,” Vivian jokes. “We just play for fun, you know?”


She’s been getting a bit more exercise lately too. She’s taken up bowling again, though Vivian admits she doesn’t yet know if she will keep playing.


“Well I am 86 and my back is 86,” laughs Vivian. “I don’t want to admit that but it is and it’s starting to tell on me.”",

  subtitles: "The Port aux Basques Fire Department during a roll out call in October 2020. Despite operating from a regional base, the lack of cell service in some of the areas they respond to remains a cause for concern. – Rosalyn Roy / Wreckhouse Press Inc.",
  body: "SOUTHWEST COAST – Apart from the poor cell service, Larry Peckford seems to have had a pleasant vacation during his stay in the Codroy Valley this summer. But his continued frustration with the lack of a cell signal prompted Peckford to lodge more than one complaint with his carrier when he returned home to Ontario in early October.


“Service coverage that is advertised by you as being LTE was totally unsatisfactory. Dropped calls were frequent and the additional data I purchased was almost useless because of poor cell signal. Residents of this area regularly are purchasing cell boosters to access service,” wrote Peckford to Virgin Mobile, stating that the trouble was not specific to any one area of the Codroy Valley.


Demanding recompense, Peckford wrote, “The towers serving the area appear inadequate and a review is needed to provide better cell service.”


He also sent similar letters to the CCTS (Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Service) and Wreckhouse Weekly (Letters to the Editor, Nov. 2). At the heart of these letters Peckford zeroed in on his chief concern – reaching emergency services.


“My need to call an ambulance for a family member was potentially compromised as I had to move about my property to get a signal,” wrote Peckford, who eventually got a response.


“Virgin categorized my complaint as a ‘trending ticket’, basically saying it is nothing they can resolve in the short term. I think they get it and, although they are associated with Bell, I doubt they have any control over cell towers and infrastructure. That’s where the problem is in my mind,” Peckford told the Wreckhouse Weekly last week.


Emergency responders across the region readily admit their response times have been compromised more than once because of the poor cell service.


RCMP Corporal Colin Helm plainly admits, “Cell phone service could use some work. Times are changing, and people are moving from landlines to cell phones and thats not always a benefit to first responders.”


Helm goes on to explain that there have been multiple occasions in the past where they have received a 911 call but due to location, the call gets dropped. 


The Fire Department chiefs of three communities concur. 


Chief Eddie Brenton of Rose Blanche said quite simply, “We don’t have any.”


He agrees that having cell service would be a big help, allowing people in the area to call emergency departments in the event of a roadside event for example. 


Chief Brian Osmond of the Codroy Valley Fire Department cited one prime example of the consequences of no signals. 


“We had a passerby who got to an accident, and he had a cell phone, but he had to leave the scene to get a cell signal.”


MHA Andrew Parsons (Burgeo-LaPoile) is well aware of the ongoing problems with cell service and not just within his own riding.


“Cell service has been a ten year project for me,” said Parsons on Tuesday, Nov. 17. “I drove across the province today. There’s a million dead spots. It’s an issue.”


Two years ago the department of Tourism, Culture, Industry and Innovation (TCII) reached out to communities along Route 470 about an opportunity to partner with Bell for a pilot project.


Parsons says that under the proposed project, Bell, the province and then the communities would each carry part of the cost for putting in new towers to increase service.


“Back in 2018, the former department (TCII) reached out and said there were three options for cell service, but when they broke it down there were two that were viable from a cost perspective and coverage,” says Parsons.


One option, called Simple Cell, involved putting in new poles that would reach the three communities of Rose Blanche-Harbour Le Cou, Burnt Islands and Isle aux Morts. That would have increased cell service coverage along most of Route 470, not just within the three towns.

“The total cost was estimated around 900 thousand. Out of that, Bell would have paid 450 thousand. Government would have paid 225 thousand, and the towns would have been asked to pay 225 thousand, which would have been 75 thousand per community,” stated Parsons.


That option was turned down, but Parsons revealed that there was a second option too. Under a plan called Small Cell, the coverage would have been restricted to prime locations by using fibre optic service instead. It would have augmented service at key points near different business and community centres.


“The problem with that was not everywhere would get service. It would expand for the entire vicinity geographically,” notes Parsons.


Costing estimates for the Small Cell program would have required the towns to still invest 25 per cent of the overall cost, roughly 15 thousand dollars, while Bell contributed 50 per cent and the province picked up the last 25 per cent.


“You’re looking at basically a 15 thousand dollar contribution for one tower,” said Parsons. “You could buy two towers at 30 thousand.”


All three communities rejected this option too, citing budgetary concerns.


Naturally one of the chief criticisms of asking towns to help pay for new infrastructure is that Bell is going to earn revenue by upgrading service, and should therefore be responsible for incurring the entirety of the cost.


“That’s not how this works,” observed Parsons. “It’s a private entity and they’re looking at return on investment.”




Town Response

The fact of the matter is that the population continues to decline along Route 470. Even before the financial hit brought on by the COVID-19 shutdowns, towns were struggling to balance their budgets just to provide basic essential services.


“Isle aux Morts has brown water, sewers still going into the coves, roads that have basically no pavement left,” wrote Mayor Nelson Lillington via e-mail. “Council had, and still has, much more pressing needs than spend 75 grand for better cell coverage.”


While Lillington agrees that more cell coverage would be nice, he noted that Isle aux Morts currently enjoys about 90 per cent coverage within the town.


Even partnering with the other two communities didn’t put the cost of upgrades within range, and towns are already incurring bank loans to maintain or upgrade aging and damaged infrastructure.


Other areas of the province have taken advantage of the Small Cell partnership with Bell.


“This very arrangement has been used in St. Anthony, in southern Labrador. It’s getting used in multiple rural areas around the province,” said Parsons. “The 25 per cent does not have to be by a municipality. It just has to be by someone else.”


Some communities have taken to fundraising to get the necessary investment money, and in one case a private entrepreneur partnered with Bell to expand service as part of a business initiative.


Prior to the pandemic, communities along Route 470, like most in the province, held annual events to attract tourists and help drive revenues, but they are typically earmarked to help offset future events.


“Ann Harvey Days and Come Home Years are run by committees and not the Town Council. These committees use the revenues from one event to pay for the next years event. Therefore, there was no thought of asking those committees to provide funding for cell service,” wrote Lillington.


Parsons, who is currently serving as the Minister of Industry, Innovation and Technology, believes he can still get the cell service upgraded if communities are willing to help with the installation expense.


“If you had to raise everybody’s tax by ten dollars you’d have it paid off in a reasonable period of time,” said Parsons. “This is what I would call a rational, logical municipal expenditure.”


Stadiums and walking trails don’t necessarily provide a return on investment either, notes Parsons, but they get funded because they have more than one perceived benefit.


Parsons observed that cell service also goes beyond quality of life to impacting safety, tourism and even the economy.


“As the minister responsible for this department for three months I would go out of my way, I would love nothing more than to be able to make this a reality for my district under this funding opportunity from my department,” said Parsons. “I think it’s a worthwhile cost. I think there’s a way to figure it out and I know that there’s a will.”


In the meantime, fixed wireless service is coming soon to Isle aux Morts and Burnt Islands. In the midst of a global pandemic, that will improve internet service, facilitating better business networking and remote learning, for example.


“That’s been committed to by Bell. I’ve been working on that for a while,” said Parsons. “This is hopefully going to get between 270 to 280 homes in Isle aux Morts and Burnt Islands better internet.”


Parsons hopes to see that service expand too, but the topography is a bit trickier closer to Rose Blanche or Margaree due to line of sight and the hills that can interfere with the signal.


“There’s limitations on the technology,” admitted Parsons.




Bell Aliant Responds

Responding to e-mail inquiries, a spokesperson for Bell confirmed the pending upgrade.


“Bell will be launching our new high-speed Wireless Home Internet service in Newfoundland and Labrador this year starting with the communities of Burnt Islands and Isle aux Morts. We’ll be letting residents know when the service is available in their area, and they can also visit Bell.ca/FastInternet to check for updates on service availability for their residence,” wrote Katie Hatfield, Corporate Communications for Bell Aliant.

Hatfield also outlined some of the challenges relating to Bell’s ability to upgrade cell service coverage in Newfoundland and Labrador.


“Network expansion in rural and sparsely populated regions is always a challenge for private investment alone by companies like Bell. While we continue to invest more than any other communications company in network infrastructure, we also continue to participate in provincial and federal programs to help accelerate broadband expansion in more remote locations.”


Noted Hatfield, “We’ve also been significantly investing in upgrading network capacity on an ongoing basis throughout COVID-19 to manage the increased volumes by consumers, businesses, governments and public safety providers. In fact, we are in the process of upgrading LTE speeds in your area at the Dr. Charles L. LeGrow Health Centre, the Bruce II Sports Centre and the Grand Bay Mall.”


Larger towns like Port aux Basques already have fibre op internet service with Bell, and other than an interfering hill here and there the cell service is also quite reliable.




Port aux Basques

Still, Fire Chief Jerry Musseau of the Channel-Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department says that their department is mostly affected by the need to call for resources.


“If we get to a scene and there is no cell phone service in that area, then we have to send a firefighter away in a truck to try to find a signal, and make a call for additional resources.”


The Port aux Basques department responds to vehicle accidents out as far as Codroy Pond, and the spotty cell coverage in key areas is problematic for them too.


“We would just not be able to make a call for any help or get any resources at all otherwise.”",

  body: "On December 6, 1989 at Université de Montreal’s École Polytechnique,  a man entered a classroom, separated the male and female students and shouted at the women “You’re all a bunch of feminists and I hate feminists”.


He shot six women dead. He continued his rampage throughout the school, killing a total of fourteen women in a violent, unfathomable act of hate and misogyny. Misogyny is, in its most simple definition, the hatred of women. He injured fourteen others – ten women and four men.


These fourteen women died simply because they were women. In a letter, he expressed his frustration at “feminists”, at women who were “stealing opportunities” from men, and listed names of more women who he hoped to kill.


I was ten years old when this tragedy happened. And because of my age, likely, I was protected from even knowing what had happened. My parents didn’t tell me, it wasn’t talked about at school and I wasn’t watching the news or scrolling any social media feeds. It is hard to imagine how that would have impacted me, knowing that someone would want to kill me just because of my gender or because of the career choices I would make, somehow being seen as imposing in a man’s world.


The women  murdered that day are more than just names on a plaque. They were in school, with hopes and dreams for the future. Twelve  of these women wanted to be engineers. One was studying to be a nurse. Another worked as a budget clerk. They played sports, loved music. Some were about to graduate with job offers waiting. They had families who loved them.  Someone else’s hate and misogyny took away their futures and shocked millions of other women into facing a reality that misogyny was not something you learn about in a textbook, but was, and still is, very real in our own country.  


December 6 is now the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women in Canada. Established by the Parliament of Canada, this day marks the anniversary of the murders in Montreal and also represents an opportunity for Canadians to reflect on the continued issue of violence against women in our country. Finally, it is a day to consider what more we can do to finally eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls.


Thirty one years later, violence against women continues. In 2018, a man used a van to run down  pedestrians on the streets of Toronto, murdering ten people. The murderer’s expressed motive was his hatred of women. Most recently, the tragic mass murders in Nova Scotia are believed to have started with a vicious and violent attack on the murderer’s female partner. 


But to this day, the most dangerous place for a woman remains to be her own home. On average,  every six days in our country, a woman is killed by her intimate partner.  And even more devastating is that these statistics get tragically worse for Indigenous women.  And if the rates of murder aren’t scary enough, consider that Statistics Canada reports that half of all Canadian women have experienced at least one incident of sexual or physical violence in their lifetime.


Behind every statistic is a face, a story and trauma that reverberates through our hearts, families and community. Within the current pandemic, we know that things have gotten worse for many women, as we spend more and more time at home, isolated.


The rates of gender based violence demonstrate the urgent need for change. We can all make a difference. We can challenge sexist stereotypes, comments and jokes.   While some may think this is harmless, it actually supports a culture in which women are inferior. We can teach our kids that there are no such things as “boy colours” or “girly toys”.


We can teach consent to our children and talk about respect and equality in our homes and schools. We can help women experiencing violence by believing their story, letting them know it is not their fault and helping them find support. We can advocate that our systems provide appropriate, trauma-informed supports. We can reflect on our own behaviours, educate ourselves and aim to do better. We can demand public education initiatives that will address the root causes of femicide and misogyny.  Together we can help end violence against women. 


For more than twenty years the Gateway Status of Women Council has commemorated December 6 in partnership with the Port aux Basques  College of the North Atlantic by holding a special memorial service on their campus.  This year, in respect of public health guidelines, we will not be holding our traditional service but we will still mark this important day on our Facebook page.


 We ask our community to join us by placing a (battery operated) candle in their window during the evening  hours of December 6th.  You may also see luminaries at various businesses around town, calling attention to not only the memory of the fourteen women who died so many years ago in Montreal, but the sobering reality of  continuing violence against women and girls and a time to reflect on what we can all do to eliminate it.

The second wave of COVID-19 is raging across the country, and across the planet as a whole. 


If you feel it doesn’t affect you then consider this – I was scheduled to get my son for the holidays, but now due to a huge surge of cases in Nova Scotia that is very much up in the air. I don’t know if he will get home for Christmas this year, and it will be devastating for our entire family now that the Atlantic bubble has been burst.


Deer Lake is under a form of lock down with spread being found in a school there. As a parent I’m prone to worrying about all children. 


In the first wave, we had almost no cases on the West Coast, but this time, it has already gotten closer.


Vigilance is more important than ever, and masks and social distancing help to keep everyone safe. This is the reason behind the provincial law mandating wearing a mask in public. This has been required by provincial law since August 24, so it is not new. 


Yes it is uncomfortable, yes it sucks, and yes my glasses fog up. But I wear a mask. I wear it because I have no choice.


It’s the law, and it’s the one thing keeping me from encountering someone who might have gotten off the ferry and decided to get a bag of chips or put away the gas pump before I reach for it.


I don’t know who is in a store, who has coughed in an aisle, and who is asymptomatic but has COVID-19 and is spreading it. 


That makes it all the more infuriating when I enter a business in this province, and the staff do not enforce the mandate to wear a mask. Most of the time they don’t even abide by their own posted signage, such as limiting how many people can be inside at one time, or following the directional arrows on the floors. 


If a bank or a government office says that the lobby is limited to three or four people, then I wait outside until I’m able to enter. But I have been in lines where there are suddenly half a dozen people or more or someone wanders around aimlessly. I’ve yet to witness anyone on staff say anything to the violators of these rules.


I have walked into a gas station, and seen a town employee standing at the counter chatting with no mask on, yet he still gets served without any correction by the staff. This is far more common that you might think.


I can count more than a dozen times in the last two weeks that I’ve been in a business where someone has no mask on.


If we are to remain free of COVID-19 here, then its our responsibility to make sure we wear a mask, and if we don’t have one, then we do NOT enter a place of business. 


Frankly, if staff at the stores in this province don’t want to offend a customer by saying “get out” or “wear a mask”, then the efforts of those of us who are worried or outright terrified of this disease are useless. Further to that, it also tells me that the staff at some stores care more about a potential sale than a potential death.


Please, I’m begging you... just wear a mask. Thank you.",

    subtitles: "PAB Mayor John Spencer has been advocating against Marine Atlantic's federally mandated cost recovery practices, saying it's unfair to Newfoundland residents who pay extra for choosing to live in the province. - J. René Roy / Wreckhouse Press Inc.",
    body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Mayor John Spencer held a live stream information session on Wednesday evening, Nov. 25 to examine the effects of Marine Atlantic’s federally mandated cost recovery charges, which he says impacts all residents and businesses of Newfoundland and Labrador.


Originally the information session, entitled Cost Recovery: Death Knoll to a Dream of Fairness and Equality Within Confederation, was slated to accommodate 15 guests with proper social distancing at the Bruce II Sport Centre. Spencer and Town Council decided instead to close the event to the public in the wake of increased reports of COVID-19 within the province.


The live stream, hosted by Wreckhouse Weekly, is available for viewing in its entirety on the newspaper’s Facebook page.


During the session, Spencer covered multiple facets of cost recovery, and cited examples of the effects that can be seen in the daily lives of all residents on the Southwest Coast and beyond.


One of his key talking points surrounded increased costs for consumers on almost everything, such as having to pay $8 for a container of strawberries.


“In 2015 the Retail Council of Canada stated the people of Newfoundland and Labrador pay anywhere from 5 per cent to 25 per cent more for perishables due to transportation challenges that currently exist,” stated the mayor.


The province currently imports 90 per cent of its fruits and vegetables and 99 per cent of its beef. The ferry service transports nearly 80 per cent of all commercial traffic to and from the island, meaning markups on pharmaceuticals, lumber, propane, vehicles and everyday household items are routine.


In another example, Spencer showed receipts the Town of Port aux Basques paid for one shipment from a large freight company. 


In addition to the cost of the freight, one receipt shows that Port aux Basques paid a cost recovery ferry surcharge of $119.44 and a fuel surcharge of $563.52 over and above the freight it was shipping.


Spencer says it's not merely the freight that increases costs to provincial taxpayers, but also personal travel. 


During his presentation, the mayor showed his own ticket stub for a personal trip he took across the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Spencer was charged $11.70 for a fuel surcharge, then another $18.19 fuel surcharge for his vehicle. 


Cost recovery policies were a campaign target of Justin Trudeau when he first ran for Prime Minister.


At a 2017 Town Hall Meeting in Peterborough, Ontario, Trudeau committed to, “Look at what can be done to make sure that people are able to travel freely, travel efficiently and openly across this country at modest cost.”


 But in a Privy Council report last year, that promise was omitted from Trudeau’s mandated priorities sent to each cabinet minister. 


Marine Atlantic has a mandated cost recovery of 65 to 100 per cent on some items or services, which means that everything within the province is subjected to a substantial surcharge before consumers even see it in stores. This allows transportation companies to offset the enormous surcharge costs they pay when using Marine Atlantic to deliver freight.


And while Prince Edward Island has a guarantee in place that does not allow for tolls to increase at a higher rate than the cost of living index, Newfoundland has no such guarantee. So while Confederation Bridge tolls have risen 35 per cent over 22 years, Newfoundland ferry rates have more than doubled within that time.


“Cost recovery has to end,” concluded Spencer.",

Dr. Luke Gillespie and Nurse Agatha Catania are at a loss for words as they are medical professionals and look to science to solve the mystery of this illness. 


Sgt. Nicholas Myra of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary has his work cut out for him and in all of his career has never come across anything remotely comparable to this situation. 

Parish Father, Peter Cooke, is called upon by His Holiness, the Pope, to help draw people back into the church. Father Cooke gives a news conference outside of the Catholic Church and the whole world is speechless needless to say. The next church service has the church filled to capacity and beyond. 


Meanwhile the Archbishop is slowly dying and his episodes of bleeding leave him spent and the doctors have to give him blood transfusions to help keep him alive. His assistant, Father Charles Horan sits outside his room waiting in the hopes that the doctors can help. 


As more cases arrive, Sgt. Nicholas Myra is scrambling to get a task force in place to help with the demands of the history of these patients as they arrive in the Emergency Department. He is sickened at the stories of abuse and torture that he uncovers. Operation Wormwood is born. 


Is there really such a disease that punishes these child molesters? The members of the Catholic Church believe so. And it lies upon the medical team to search for scientific answers for the explanation, all while having doubts if the church is correct in their belief that Wormwood exists. 


This book is a thrill of a ride that keeps you on the edge, trying to connect all of the characters as it delves into an important topic. 


Final rating: 5 out of 5 stars!",

  body: "For the week of November 30, 2020.


ARIES 

Things will get easier for you. You will want to travel and explore new ideas and meet people from different backgrounds because you want to expand your world! And you will. However don’t trust everyone you meet – not everyone has pure intentions like you do.


TAURUS

Focus on shared property, taxes, debt, loans, mortgages, inheritances and the responsibilities you have for others will be stronger. You will have successful discussions with everyone. This will help you clarify and explain issues to others. You will express your affection to others more easily. There may even be improvement in your relations with enemies or anyone with whom you are in conflict. It’s a good thing.


GEMINI

Your energy will be flagging. This means you need more sleep. In addition, it means it’s time to bring your affairs to a culmination, but be careful about dealing with authority figures. If you have a sense of failure about something, accept this and move on. You can start over. 


CANCER

Adventures and fun times are on the horizon. You will want to get better organized and figure out how to work efficiently. Even if you are your own boss, your actions will be dictated by others at this time. Nevertheless, explore sports, social activities and romantic dreams.


LEO

Lucky you! This week is promising because it will be more playful, more lighthearted and more fun-loving. Enjoy happier relations with kids and warmer relationships with your main squeeze. You have a strong urge to express yourself; maybe redecorate. Expect to enjoy warmer relations with family. Meanwhile, you should explore new ideas and finish major projects.


VIRGO

You will welcome this chance to stay at home this week and focus on your private life, home and family. You also might be more involved with a parent. Childhood memories and discussions about the past will pop up. Appreciate your daily surroundings. 


LIBRA

You will have a busy schedule of appointments, errands, discussions with others, increased involvement with relatives and siblings, as well as being more active reading, writing and studying. You likely will get burned out quickly so don’t hesitate to take time for yourself this week. It’s nice to help others but remember who comes first.


SCORPIO

You are diplomatic and charming at the same time which increases your desire to relate to others. Enjoy good times with friends. It’s also an excellent time to change your wardrobe. You will have a busy mind and be keen to communicate. However this can be turned back on to yourself so be careful. 


SAGITTARIUS

You are energized, sassy, and keen to express yourself. The Sun will also attract favourable situations and people to you. You may dig up solutions to old problems. Now relations with romantic partners will improve, as well as relations with family. 


CAPRICORN

The window of time to retreat has arrived. This means many of you will choose to be more reclusive and perhaps work alone or behind the scenes. However, two influences will counter this impulse and it will definitely encourage discussions with friends, especially groups. You might want to discuss problems with others or your future goals, but keep it to yourself.


AQUARIUS

You might also question your role in a group. One thing is certain, although you want to work with a friend or a team, it’s important for you to establish who you are. You need to maintain your own image. You might also want to pick apart your friends because in large measure, they are a reflection of who you are. Relations with parents and authority figures will be at an all time high.


PISCES

You are in a spotlight, and this spotlight is flattering! This means others admire you and think you are super capable even if you don’t do anything special. Because you have all this going for you, now is the time to advance yourself! Ask for what you want! Jump in and go for it",

Instead of holding the protest during a council meeting on Saturday, Nov. 28 as originally planned, Janes says, “Due to the rise in COVID-19 cases in the Western Region, we are going to cancel the protest at this time.”


Opting to take the safest path, Janes states that they will be instead asking for an online protest.


“We are asking people to inundate Brendan Mitchell, the Chief of Qalipu First Nations with their stories and to contact Gudie Hutchings’ office as well.”


The protest is regarding the over ten thousand status members who were removed from the founding members list of Qalipu First Nations under a supplemental agreement.


Janes is unaware of the reason for exclusion, hence the reason for the original plan of protest. 


“We are ready to go to jail for this. Every time council sits, we will be there, and we will ramp up our protests.”",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Jody Anderson of Port aux Basques and Peter Rossiter of O’Regan’s were both convicted of injuring or endangering an animal (CCC 1985 [445-a]). Judge Lynn Cole rendered her decision in Stephenville court last Tuesday, Dec. 2. Cole stayed charges of unlawfully causing an animal unnecessary suffering.


Anderson had been fostering Mittens, a cat that had lost its owner and was subsequently taken into care by rescue group In Memory of Shadow.


During the trial held in Port aux Basques on Wednesday, Oct. 29, a witness testified seeing both Anderson and Rossiter enter a bathroom with the cat, an empty garbage bag and an axe. When they re-emerged, something was being carried in the bag and the cat was not seen again.


Cole acknowledged that there were some minor inconsistencies with the witness testimony, but that this was not out of the ordinary and, “the only reasonable explanation of what happened to the cat is that it was killed by either Mr. Rossiter or Ms. Anderson or both.”


Velda Tapp Pretty, who also testified at the trial, is with the In Memory of Shadow rescue.


“I am not surprised by the verdict at all. I knew from day one they were both guilty. It was proving what I knew and I did. Without the body of Mittens I was concerned, but enough evidence was left behind to prove what was testified against them was indeed true,” said Pretty.


She noted the crucial role the chief witness played in securing justice for Mittens.


“I actually feel very sorry for that lady. She was a victim. She was in the wrong place at the wrong time with very bad company unknown to her. No cell phone, no house phone and no vehicle,” noted Pretty. “In this case she is Mittens’ true hero. Without her testifying we wouldn’t have been able to get that guilty plea.”


Pretty has been fierce in her efforts to secure tougher penalties for those who would harm animals.


“I am active now in a group called Time For Change 2020. We have a petition going across Newfoundland and Labrador where we need actual signatures to pass to the government demanding they look at the laws and penalties for animal cruelty.”


Pretty admits it has been rough going now and then.


“I walked alone with very little support. Some of my Shadow friends stuck this out with me and members of other outside rescues,” she said.


While she continues her quest to get the laws changed, Pretty continues to work on writing her victim impact statement, a process she began last year.


“The effects on the community, the shame and the little children that this affected, is brutal. So yes I want them know that, even to her it was an (expletive) old cat he was our cat and he meant a lot to a lot of people, especially his deceased owner and his life counted just like hers.


She had a choice to at any time pick up the phone and return him to the shelter or one the volunteers... Open the door and put him out,” noted Pretty. “She made the choice to murder and get support to do so.”


Anderson and Rossiter will be sentenced on Jan. 22, 2021 in Stephenville.


Said Pretty, “I would like to see the maximum penalty imposed and also a lifetime of not being permitted to own an animal as a pet.”

  subtitles: "Steven Hiscock - submitted",
  body: "BURGEO – Counc. Steven Hiscock has nothing but praise for Stephenville RCMP, but says Burgeo needs its own detachment back. The town has been without its own RCMP officers since October.


“It’s not too bad because the Stephenville detachment comes out on random (patrols),” says Hiscock, who figures he’s seen an RCMP cruiser fairly regularly, and almost always on Fridays too.


He doesn’t think any increase in impaired driving or speeding is related to the lack of police presence either.


“There was an increase in that before they even left,” admits Hiscock. “You know how it is. After you’ve got one cop here for six years and another for three years in a small community with very little crime, it gets relaxed.”


Hiscock, who is the on air reporter for Burgeo Broadcasting, conducted an interview around July with Assistant Commissioner Ches Parsons who is the Commanding Officer of the RCMP.


“His philosophy is that officers are only supposed to stay in a small community for two years and one officer has been here for six,” said Hiscock.


In a letter dated Aug. 12 addressed to Mayor George Reid, Parsons promised that the RCMP has no plans to close or downsize the Burgeo detachment permanently. The primary problem with finding officers to station at the Burgeo detachment can be attributed to the ongoing global pandemic.


“RCMP NL continues to police the province to fulfil its mandate to protect public safety, enforce the law, and ensure the delivery of priority policing services in Newfoundland and Labrador,” stated Media Relations Officer Cpl. Jolene Garland via e-mail.


“The unprecedented situation of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the number of newly trained RCMP officers coming out of the RCMP Training Centre (depot) in Regina, which is impacting resources across Canada. The RCMP Training Centre was closed for a period of time to protect the health and wellness of employees and applicants, which slowed staffing processes. This was a temporary measure and training has resumed at a lower capacity, although this could, of course, change depending on the spread of COVID-19.”


Responding to inquiries, Garland also said that Burgeo is not the only RCMP detachment currently unstaffed.


“Other Detachments currently unstaffed and receiving coverage from neighbouring Detachments include Flower’s Cove and Grand Bank (note that Grand Bank has one police officer staffed in the community with coverage from Marystown when the officer is off shift).”


Garland was unable to determine exactly when these detachments might have new officers assigned.


“While we cannot commit to a specific time line, plans are in motion to staff the positions in Burgeo as soon as possible. In the interim, policing services will be provided by the Bay St. George Detachment. This is a normal process in smaller detachment areas both in Newfoundland and Labrador and throughout the country during times when officers have to leave the area for training, vacation, or any other reason. Crime rates in Burgeo remain low and police not only respond to calls for service in the area but make proactive patrols on a routine basis to ensure the delivery of policing services to the community.”


Hiscock notes that Parsons was also unable to provide a definitive time line.


“He said it could be as late as April. Now he said he’s hoping it’s not going to be that long,” said Hiscock.


And while Stephenville might be covering the region sufficiently, the worry is that they will not be able to continue that once the winter sets in.


“Our Burgeo road is closed very often during the winter. It could be closed for the week. It all depends, right? Then the only way to get into Burgeo is by helicopter or by boat, and that depends on the weather also,” noted Hiscock.


The Burgeo Volunteer Fire Department is there to help with emergencies in the interim, and that does ease the concern somewhat.


“I think that Burgeo has got one of the better fire departments than most small communities,” offered Hiscock.


But the Burgeo RCMP’s reach extends well beyond that one community too.


“They police Ramea, Grey River, Francois,” observed Hiscock. “Even though they’re a boat ride away.”


Hiscock says Parsons has promised that in the event that Stephenville cannot respond then Corner Brook or Deer Lake would.


“He said that he’s making sure that if you guys need police services, you guys will have it,” said Hiscock.


Hiscock says the town has received reassurances from Parsons, MP Gudie Hutchings (Long Range Mountains) and MHA Andrew Parsons (Burgeo - La Poile) about the police services, but the fact remains that, “The community would really like for the force to be here as it was.”",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The Channel-Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department received a major upgrade last week. A brand new 2020 Freightliner pumper truck was finally delivered to the department’s fire hall, and Fire Chief Jerry Musseau couldn’t be happier. 


“It’s something we have been after for eight or nine years here, because our oldest fire truck here is now thirty years old, and parts are hard to find,” said Musseau.


Funding for the new truck was approved in April 2019, with the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador paying seventy percent of the bill, and the Town of Channel-Port aux Basques paying the remaining thirty percent. 


According to Mayor John Spencer, the price of the new pumper ended up costing the Town somewhere around $113,000. 


“Of course a special thanks goes to our MHA Andrew Parsons for all the work he put into this, and it’s a great investment for the long term future of protection and fire services of our community,” said Spencer.


Musseau says the new truck was scheduled to arrive in August, but due to unavoidable delays because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it took until the end of November to arrive.

“But (it) was well worth the wait,” said Musseau.


The new pumper had to be disinfected inside and out by Fire and Emergency Services before it could even be touched by the department’s crew, as it was delivered from out of province.  Following the disinfection, a full inspection was conducted to ensure that everything was in perfect working order. 


The new truck has a foam system, a built-in generator, a five man crew cab, roll up side panels, and a drop down tire chain system to assist with traction should the need arrive. 


Musseau says he is very pleased with the high tech vehicle, adding, “We aren’t looking forward to emergencies, but we know that someday, we are gonna need it.”


The Chief also advised that the older truck being replaced has already been moved up to the Grand Bay Substation until it can be determined as to whether or not that truck can be given to another fire department, given its age. ",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Provincial circuit court held its last session of the year at the Port aux Basques courthouse on Wednesday, Dec. 2 through Friday, Dec. 4 with Judge Lynn Cole presiding. Court will continue in Stephenville until it returns the March circuit.


Keeping

During the October circuit, Alexander John Keeping plead guilty to dangerous operation of a conveyance (CCC 2018 [320.13-1]) and possessing controlled drug or substance (CDS 1996 [4-1]).


On Thursday, Dec. 3, Judge Cole imposed a fine of $1,000 for the drug possession and $300 victim surcharge. For the dangerous driving offence, Cole ordered a $2,000 fine and a $600 victim surcharge. Keeping will have two years to pay the fines. He is also prohibited from driving for two years.


Keeping admitted that on July 4, 2020, he was behind the wheel of a vehicle that struck a power pole while driving at a high rate of speed. RCMP attending the scene placed Keeping under arrest and subsequently found him to also be in possession of cocaine. Defence counsel Trevor Murphy noted that although Keeping had been through recovery, cocaine was not his ‘drug of choice’ and there was nothing to indicate that he was under its influence at the time of the accident.


Judge Cole acknowledged that relapses can occur commended Keeping for seeking counseling.


Said Cole, “You’re really lucky because if anybody had been killed or seriously injured you’d be looking at a jail sentence.”


Morris

During the July circuit, Dillon Morris plead guilty to mischief relating to property – less than $5,000 (CCC 1995 [430-4-b]). The mischief involved smashing the front windshield of a vehicle in late Oct. 2018 during a domestic dispute.


On Thursday, Dec. 3, Judge Cole ordered Morris to attend counseling as recommended by both the Crown and defense attorneys. Morris has admitted to having anger management issues.


In addition, Morris was placed on a no-contact order and a probation order for the next 18 months. He also has 30 days to pay the victim fine surcharge of $100.


“I do want to encourage you with your counseling to get what you can from it so that this is an isolated occurrence,” stated Cole.",

  body: "I am happy the editor of the Wreckhouse Weekly has given me the opportunity to write in this space. When visiting my house in the Codroy Valley over the summer I was delighted to see the paper in local stores. With the loss of the Gulf News it takes some guts to start up an independently owned newspaper. It seems the southwest coast region has embraced the Weekly with carriers making home delivery. I hope that local business will get on board using the paper to advertise local products and services. 


The media landscape has changed mightily in the last decade with the internet and social media taking over as a place for news and information sharing. Internet web sites and news bundling from various sources make publishing a newspaper a challenge. Google and Facebook, for instance, literally steal from the mainline media by posting stories that previously came by way of the newspaper or local radio. For now, these entities virtually pay nothing for it and the news source pays the freight by way of salaries for its news people and production costs.


I recall the personalities on the former CFCB station in Port aux Basques. These guys (few women then) were household names and the radio dial was tuned to the local station all day long. If you wanted to talk to the DJ or newsreader, you likely would meet them at the post office! No problem telling them what music you liked. 


The print media is gone digital with home delivery and newsstands much less prominent. You can get your local news on the smart phone or laptop and read it when and where you like. One opportunity that newspapers have tapped in to is the need for a paid subscription if you want to get all that they publish. The Weekly is doing this too so I paid my online subscription to get it all….not just the headlines. The large national newspapers are fighting back too as online subscriptions are yielding more and more revenue. Without it, they cannot survive.


In a similar way, our TV viewing has changed, as over the air reception (roof antennas and rabbit ears) is a thing of the past. Pick the channels you like and go to it. For me living in Ontario I get my news fix by paying subscriptions to those news sources I like. I just recently paid to view Newfoundland’s NTV channel so I can get their excellent supper hour news package.


So, Kudos to the folks at the Weekly for their bravery in starting up this venture. I will bring my perspective on things from time to time. A Newfie living in Ontario is not a strange thing even though on times I wish I could bury the accent and go incognito when doing business or exchanging with the locals. Newfoundlanders have a habit of finding each other too as I almost regularly find out. Anyway, we’ll talk again! Stay safe.",

CANCER – Your personal secrets may be revealed. Don’t share your dilemma with those you work with. You should get out and meet new people this week. Deal with the needs of children and elders. Lend a helping hand.


LEO – Be sure to think twice before you say something that might hurt.. Your emotions may be hard to control if someone is forcing you to undergo change. Be prepared to have relatives or close friends introduce you to new and exciting people.


VIRGO – You’ll be pleased with the results if you take the time to decorate your home. You will encounter those who can help you further your goals and ambitions.. Disruptions may set you back, but you’re strong, and in the end the choices you make will be favorable. 


LIBRA – You can expect opposition from family as well as colleagues. Your communication skills will bring you popularity and increased self esteem. Don’t let your personal problems interfere with your professional responsibilities. Focus your efforts on your work.


SCORPIO – You can pick up some overtime this week. Invite friends over rather than spending money on things.. Someone may be reluctant to tell you how they feel. Lowered vitality could affect your work. 


SAGITTARIUS – Plan to visit friends or relatives. If you can work at home, do so. Do not yield to children or relatives when they really don’t deserve it. Your temper could get the better of you if you confront personal situations.


CAPRICORN – You may be able to get some good advice about your personal problems. You’ll find it easy to deal with government agencies or large institutions. Don’t overspend to impress others. It might be best to spend time fixing up your premises and making changes that will be appreciated.


AQUARIUS – Now is good to invest your time into someone. It’s time to get yourself back on track. Unexpected events may be upsetting. You can’t control the actions of others- only the reaction of yourself.


PISCES – Try to spend time with those having similar priorities. Opportunities to travel will develop through peers. Don’t allow colleagues to put unreasonable pressure on you. If you want to make an impact try to get involved in projects that will bring you some glory and good fortune.",

  body: "BURGEO – The town’s office and council chambers have almost completed their move into the former Federal building.


“The town acquired the building from the Feds for $12,000. Which was a steal,” laughed Counc. Steven Hiscock. “The Town of Burgeo was actually looking for a new location for the town council and the Federal government decided to sell this building.”


That’s much lower than the $20,000 the Federal government was still asking for it back in August.


The previous town building needed expensive repairs, which prompted the move.


“The floor in the main chambers was getting really bad I believe,” said Hiscock. “It would’ve cost more to fix that building then to buy the other.”


The move may also turn out to be a solid long-term investment. The town will continue to lease out space to various business tenants, which will not only cover the purchase but even turn a profit.


The post office rents half the ground floor space, and Service Canada is also renting a part of the main floor. Meanwhile the Community Youth Network is renting space in the upper floor of the building.


“The post office pays, I believe, close to 40 grand a year in rent,” offered Hiscock.


Council chambers have been relocated to the top floor of the building, while the town manager and town clerk have offices on the ground floor. Hiscock says it’s not yet clear what the town will do with the old building.


“That’s something I’ve got to ask next meeting,” said Hiscock.


The next council meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, Dec. 16 at 7:30 p.m.",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – “It’s been a busy week”, says Channel-Port aux Basques Mayor John Spencer. “With the new fire truck arriving, and with our new Municipal Garage officially being opened here this morning, it has been a good week.”


The opening of the new $3.5 million dollar facility on Hopedale Avenue has been beleaguered by delays thanks to COVID-19 supply issues, but on Friday morning, it was officially opened by Mayor Spencer and MHA Andrew Parsons (Burgeo-La Poile). Town employees and members of council were also present for the official opening of the new facility.


The building has state of the art technology according to Town Manager Leon MacIsaac. 


“It’s equipped with an ERV-1 Heat pump system, there are backup pumps, and a backup oil heating system. Everything is on a SCADA system. Thats an electronic system for heating and cooling, which can be controlled from the main office in St John’s,” says MacIsaac.


MacIsaac says the building is a major upgrade over the old facility, featuring amenities not available in the old town depot, which is located downtown across from Town Hall.


The new depot has extras that include male and female washrooms, change rooms, shower facilities, and laundry service. There’s also a full kitchen and large dining area.


The building was cost shared in a 50/50 split with the federal and provincial governments. 

There are still some finishing touches to be put in, such as paving and landscaping, which can’t be done until the spring. 


Mayor Spencer says the new modern depot is a dream that started back in the 1990s when he was a member of council.


“It’s a fantastic facility, long overdue,” says Spencer. “It’s a safe working environment for our workers, and it’s somewhere they can come to work in the morning, and they can be proud of.”


There are no confirmed plans yet for the old municipal garage.


“That work starts on Monday, as to what we are going to do,” says Spencer. 


Ideally the plan is to dismantle the old garage and clean up the area. The town hopes to avail of more government funding to accomplish that.


He adds that the transition to the new depot will be gradual, adding that, “Once everything gets going, it’s our ambition that everything (including fueling of town vehicles) will be done here.”

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The last Town Council meeting for 2020 took place on Tuesday evening, Dec. 8. Deputy mayor Todd Strickland was the only councilor not in attendance. Here are some of the highlights.


Delegation

Cathy Lomond delivered a letter from the Tourism Southwest board about the significance of the ATV Trail to the region’s tourism industry. The letter outlined recent maintenance work and promotional efforts, before asking for council’s support in helping to grow the ATV tourism business, including financial support.


Grand Bay Bottom Sewer

Mayor John Spencer read notes from a recent privileged meeting that discussed the finances of the sewer project. Specifically, the Town voted to borrow $494,827.


“I don’t know if we’re going to be able to afford all this – what we’re expected to do in terms of Federal regulations. This one project is going to cost us $500,000 and we have six or seven left to start,” said Spencer.


Tax write off

Council also voted to write off poll tax that has been kept on the books for several years. Spencer noted that the tax, which is levied against residents who don’t own property, brings in a fair amount of money for the Town.


Come Home Year

Coun. Jim Lane announced that after much consideration, he had to recommend cancellation of Come Home Year 2021.


“We don’t know what’s going to happen in 2021,” said Lane. “I understand there’s a vaccine coming online. We really don’t know what kind of impact that’s going to have.”


After some discussion, Council decided to err on the side of caution and supported the recommendation to cancel the festivities.


Taxi permit

A letter to Council asked for a permit to operate a new taxi business. The private operator seeks to run a single vehicle and be the only driver. Ideally the entrepreneur would like to start during this Christmas season.


Council noted that the person has a significant amount of experience and is familiar with the regulations surrounding the taxi industry, but requires some clarification before the permit can be issued.


Budget 2021

Mayor Spencer stated it was a particularly difficult budget to pull together this time as the effects of the pandemic continue to wreak havoc on the overall economy and by extension this region. Despite the difficulty, Council has no plan for any tax increases in 2021.


“Groceries going up a minimum of five percent. I see the poverty. I see the strain. I see the evidence around the community of people not seeing their families, of people not being able to travel,” saidSpencer. “It was a difficult year.”


Even though the town shut down Bruce II Sports Centre, there were no revenues to offset unavoidable expenses like utilities and insurance.


Spencer noted that families already struggling to make ends meet cannot afford to pay last year’s taxes and will likely find themselves in similar circumstances next year, even with a vaccine on the horizon.


“The damage has been done.”


According to Spencer, budget meetings revealed “quite a large gap” between the town’s revenues and expenses in 2020 that will necessitate some cutbacks in 2021.


Compounding matters is that the Town’s residential property assessments dropped by $16 million and business assessments decreased by $2 million. That means a revenue loss of around $150,000 for the Town. Most residents will see a tax reduction in 2021.


Past practice has been to raise the mil rate to compensate for decreases in assessments, but Council does not intend to raise the mil rate during such rough times.


“There will be no extras in 2021,” said Spencer. “There’s no wish list for Council.”


Although borrowing rates are low, the Mayor observed that eventually those monies will have to be paid back and at this time it doesn’t make sense for Council to increase its debt load, which is currently at 14 percent even though that can be extended to 30 percent.


“We’re going to move along and struggle along until we can get out of this COVID situation,” said Spencer.",

Rotational workers are essential. Rotational workers are critical to Atlantic Canada’s economic well being. Rotational workers need reasonable connections within Atlantic Canada to travel to jobs sites.


The social and economic well being of the southwest corner of this province thrives from the benefits of being the home of so many rotational workers. We need to stand in support.

Canada has no national airline carrier addressing Canadian needs. Privatization has not worked. Privatization operates on higher fares and investor dividends.


Canadians are paying too much for movement within this vast nation. Canada, geographically, the second largest country in the world, needs a national carrier at a reasonable cost with a reasonable expectation for ease of travel for essential workers and travelling families.  


Canada needs a national airline carrier that is truly national in scope.


Privatizing Air Canada in 1989, a move designed to stimulate competition among airline carriers and place a greater emphasis on market dynamics, needs to be revisited.


It is not enough to say tough times demand tough choices. The pandemic has changed everything. Canada’s airline industry needs strategic federal and provincial support. It has to start with a national airline carrier that is truly national in scope.

John Spencer, Mayor

Use your charm, but don’t be phony. You will find your personal partner taxing this week. Misunderstandings could cause confusion and upset. Dead end projects could plague you.


TAURUS 

Your friends may not be too pleased with you. Get down to business. Take time to listen to the problems of family members. Family responsibilities are mounting. Travel opportunities should be your first choice. 


GEMINI

Rely on yourself and you will look good to superiors. Take time to deal with the concerns of children. Check your personal papers and make sure everything is in order. Changes involving your domestic scene may be unpleasant. 


CANCER

You have been at peace for some time now and you need a change of pace. Loved ones may be annoyed if they feel restricted. Be aware of deception when it comes to your position, and be sure not to jump to conclusions. Your lack of attention may become a factor. 


LEO

Avoid scandals of any sort. Take some time to change your house around. Overindulgence will be a problem if you are out in a social setting. Legal matters that have been pending may be alleviated through compromise.


VIRGO

Try to be understanding. Professionalism will be of utmost importance. You can have an enjoyable time if you socialize with friends. You will be able to make changes regarding your living arrangements.


LIBRA

Don’t try to twist things around so that they sound more enticing. You will find that social activities will be enjoyable and will promote new connections. You will not be able to contain your emotions this week. You need to keep everyone on your domestic scene too busy to complain. 


SCORPIO

Put your energy into your work or moneymaking ventures rather than into your emotional life this week. Short trips to visit others will do the whole family a world of good. Use your head and do things to your liking. Your lover will be annoyed with your participation. 


SAGITTARIUS

Your dramatic nature may be too much to handle. Take a close look at contracts and agreements that have been offered to you. Your concern with older family members and those less fortunate than yourself will only add to your attractiveness. You have to take hold of your life and make some crucial decisions.


CAPRICORN

You may have difficulty trying to get your friends to understand your position. Evasion is likely if you aren’t direct about your feelings. Concentrate on work. Look into alternatives that would better suit both your needs. 


AQUARIUS

Call a good friend. Promote your ideas now. Friendships will be ruined if you let too many people get involved in any disputes. Don’t try to deal with important issues or make changes that will upset the apple cart. 


PISCES

Don’t listen to a friend about any rumors regarding your relations, or it may be hard to rectify your relationship. Your ability to take hold of a situation will surely bring you popularity and leadership. Camping, swimming, and biking expeditions should all be considered. Your reputation will be affected.",

  subtitles: "Bob Hinks holds a photo of himself in uniform when still in service with the RCMP. Years after retirement, he remains haunted by the events he witnessed as a first responder attending the crash scene of Arrow Air flight 1285. – © J. René Roy",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Bob Hinks remembers almost every single moment, every single detail. He still calls it the worst day of his career with the RCMP.

On Thursday morning, Dec. 12 1985, Arrow Air flight 1285 took off from Gander International Airport. The plane was on the last leg of its journey from Cairo, Egypt to Fort Campbell, Kentucky. On board were 8 crew and 248 passengers, members of the famed 101st airborne division, the same division whose storied history was so well portrayed in the HBO film Band of Brothers. Flight 1285 never reached its destination, crashing only moments after takeoff.


Bob was a 32 year old RCMP Constable stationed at the Gander detachment. Gander had a detachment of 36 at the time.


Nearly two weeks earlier, the town had held an emergency drill to simulate a mock disaster. Bob recalls the drill went too well.


”Everybody was notified about the mock disaster – the fire department, the hospital, the military, but it went off too well because everybody knew about it.They were all waiting to get a call, and thats not how a disaster works.”


Because of that, the decision was made to hold another mock disaster, but without informing anyone ahead of schedule. Bob recalls the morning of December 12th perfectly. 


“I was up fairly early because my wife, Marie, had to go to work.So I was up and in my service uniform to drive her to work, and then (planning to) go in to work myself after that. As I was going through the door, the telephone rang and I answered it. And this was my boss telling me that a plane had crashed down by Gander Lake, down by Boathouse Road.”


Given the rescheduled mock disaster, Bob suspected this was the second trial run.


“I laughed at him and told him where to go.” When his boss persisted, Bob took off, “as fast as I could go.”


He arrived at the gate to the Boathouse Road where he met a fellow RCMP officer. The two made lighthearted comments about having another mock disaster so early in the morning. 

As Bob ran down the road, he recalls with absolute clarity, seeing the tops of trees cut off and fires burning.


“I remember thinking, boy, they’re really going all out with this mock disaster. They even got 45 gallon drums in the woods burning fires.”


When he got to the T-intersection, Bob came around the corner, and saw the undercarriage of an airplane, “Right in the middle of the road, and the tires were on fire.”


That’s when it hit him that this was no mock disaster. It was all too real. Another fellow officer approached and stopped Bob. 


“Frank Ward was walking towards me. and he said ‘Did you see all the dead people?’ I turned back to look, and I had walked by maybe a dozen or more people. I didn’t even see them.”


Bob and Frank began to look for survivors. As Bob walked through the woods, he recalls seeing scenes unimaginable to most.


“Body parts everywhere... airplane parts everywhere.” 


As he searched, Bob chanced upon one man in a Military Police uniform. He was sitting at the base of a tree, his legs out straight in front of him, his hands resting casually on his legs, and his sidearm at his side.


“I thought he was alive. He was just sitting there. and I asked him, ‘Are you okay’. And he was dead.”


Bob has other recollections, ones that will not be recounted here simply because of their extreme graphic nature.


He was tasked with several jobs that terrible morning, including assisting doctors through the crash site, looking for passengers they could save. They didn’t find any. 


Bob recalls one moment in particular so extreme that even one doctor got sick in the bushes.


“He had to leave the site.”


There were no survivors of Flight 1285. The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-8, had been built in 1969. The technology of the time meant that the black boxes of the aircraft were woefully out of date. They consisted of a pin that scratched a drum, able to record only a few systems, so there wasn’t a great deal of data to aid crash investigators.


Bob is the one who found the Flight Data Recorder (FDR).


“It was just sitting there, in a ditch, right on the side of the road for anyone to see. It just happened to be me.” 


To maintain chain of custody, the next day Bob was put on a private jet to Ottawa with both Black Boxes. He was the only passenger.


The investigation was a very confused affair. A terrorist group attempted to claim responsibility, and there was only limited information gleaned from the recorders. 


Investigators ultimately determined there were two key factors that caused the crash. 

The plane was subjected to constant freezing rain conditions, leaving a very thin coating of ice on the wings. It was not de-iced prior to takeoff as the ice was not easily visible. 


The other factor, ultimately dooming the flight, was that it was overweight. Fuel calculations are based on the average weight of a person, some 170 lbs for an average man, and 120 lbs for a woman. 


Flight 1285 carried 248 soldiers, all large and strong men averaging a weight of 220 lbs each, not counting their equipment. 


That weight differential, coupled with the ice conditions, doomed all onboard the moment it left the ground. 


Flight 1285 remains the deadliest crash in Canadian History, and the United States Army’s single deadliest air crash in peacetime. 


Bob ended up with PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) as a result of what he saw and experienced that day. With that came Menieres Disease, a disorder of the inner ear that causes vertigo and dizziness. 


He stayed with the RCMP for as long as he could, but eventually had to walk away in 1995, with a permanent disability. 


These days he keeps himself busy outdoors.


“Im an avid hunter, fisherman – salmon or trout, rabbits, turrs or geese. I go from season to season.”


Bob admits that he a rough night after this interview.


“I was just laying there, with everything running through my head again, and my wife had to wake me up from the nightmare.”


He enjoys watching action movies, but admits it’s a little odd that one of his favourite shows is Mayday, a show that profiles plane crashes. The show featured the Arrow Air Flight 1285 disaster on Episode 3 of Season 11, entitled Split Decision.


Despite the traumatic memories, Bob says that his best medicine are his grandchildren. Jase and London, who live in Port aux Basques not too far from him. 


“If I get a little depressed or I start thinking things that I shouldn't be thinking, I just spend some time with them, and they are my pill. That takes all my worries and woes away.”

This week has a strong focus on relationships, making this the perfect time to interact with others. You need to communicate your feelings, which can sometimes be a challenge. But the time is right for you to push out of your comfort zone and speak your mind and true thoughts. You might be feeling much more optimistic and excited about a new possibility.


CANCER (June 21 - July 22)

There is an end to many of the trials and obstacles you’ve had to deal with in the past. Hopefully you’re stronger for having been tested, and now you can take that strength and apply it to other aspects of your life in need of shaping up. This could relate to money, relations or mental health. Take some solo time this week.


LEO (July 23 - Aug. 22)

Prepare to say goodbye to all your stress and tears as you can now create new beginnings in your personal life. This might be the week that you’re able to give important relationships the time and energy they deserve, something you might have found difficult during the past because of the demands on your time and well-being. Bask in the happiness and count your blessings twice.


VIRGO (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22)

You should be clearer about what you need to make your life flow more effectively. This could involve examining and making adjustments to your daily routine, looking at how you serve others, or seeing whether putting your heart into everything you do might make a bigger difference in the lives of others. A lifestyle change is due.


LIBRA (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22)

If you’ve been wondering when life is going to get easier, then your prayers are about to be answered. This is a good week and into fun zone! Starting now life begins to open up, and you should soon find more opportunities for fun. Do whatever your heart feels and let loose for once. 


SCORPIO (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21)

You can expect a festive week, but you need to focus on home and family. You have some work to do there, but the rewards will be worth it. You might need to make a commitment to your mental health or even relocate if you’re not happy where you are. Or you might need to put your energy into improving your family dynamics or welcoming a new addition. Whatever the case may be – you got this! 


SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21)

This week will encourage you to broaden your horizons and make more of yourself. You might find yourself entertaining ideas of travel, study, adventure, or ways to communicate what you know to others, perhaps through writing, teaching, speaking or some other way of sharing your ideas, knowledge or wisdom. The key is your attitude.


CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20)

The good news is that as you move through this week, every day gets easier. While you might now be in a physically or mentally stronger place than you were years ago, you probably wouldn’t want to repeat the events of the past years so get ready to change your mental picture. Money and opportunities are on the rise.


AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 18)

Special treatment is due your way. Basically, this indicates that a new chapter of life is about to begin, so it will make sense to contemplate your life thus far. If you believe you have room for improvement, at least be mentally prepared to go in the direction that’s calling you. Much of this will revolve around your personal life, but it could also involve your professional situation and general direction. 


PISCES (Feb. 20 - March 20)

You might feel a strong urge to withdraw from the hectic part of life and enjoy more quiet time. This sets the scene for a long period of spiritual growth, and it strongly indicates a time of getting your inner world in shape. That could mean committing to a meditation program, doing yoga, journaling, starting a creative project, studying your dreams, paying attention to the signs and symbols around you, or listening to the quiet voice within.",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The Rec House, Community Youth Network (CYN) is teaching the importance of not drinking and driving during the holiday season.


Danielle Neil, Executive Director at the Rec House, got the idea from another fellow CYN group that also does the same campaign in partnership with the Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation. Danielle contacted the local liquor store in Port aux Basques and spoke with manager Valerie Clarke, who was delighted to be on board as a partner for this brown paper bag campaign.


One thousand paper bags were donated by the Port aux Basques liquor store, and labels were placed on the bags recognizing the local groups involved in the campaign.


The bags were then carried to five local schools around the Southwest coast area for grades K-12 students to design colourful, alerting messages to highlight the campaign “Drinking & Driving, Arriving Safely” during the holiday season. The student names, grades, and schools are also indicated on the bag.


Once the bags are completed by the students, they are then carried to the NL liquor store for distribution of alcohol purchases during the week before Christmas.


This is the second year for this campaign.


Last year’s feedback from community was absolutely overwhelming. Residents stated that they enjoyed seeing these bags with its important message designed by the local students.

To thank students for their hard work and the time spent on their designs to support the campaign, the Rec House will be offering prizes this year. 


Keep an eye out for these bags that will be placed at the liquor store starting on Friday, Dec. 18.


An average of 4 Canadians are killed each day, and 1,250 to 1,500 each year, due to drinking and driving. More than 63,000 are injured by impaired drivers every year.

 The Rec House, CYN and students ask that you please think responsibly during the holiday season. Please don’t drink and drive.",

  body: "CODROY – Volunteers of the Holy Trinity Church were busy handing out free Christmas turkey dinners with all the trimmings on a blustery, frosty Friday afternoon, Dec. 18.

Howard Farrell estimates that the church would give away around 310 dinners to members of its congregation and their loved ones this year. That is almost double the 160 dinners it gave away in its first year.


“Our church wanted to reach out to the community over the last three years. This has become an annual event now, to do up a Christmas dinner,” said Farrell.


“Basically we felt the Christmas spirit and the spirit of our Lord and Saviour. We felt the need to get out into the community and this is the way we’ve been doing it.”


The dinners are paid for by the church’s outreach budget, but Farrell says that many of the people who are enjoying the dinners are choosing to reciprocate.


“People in their generosity have made donations of food and vegetables and monetary donations.”


“Hopefully we haven’t missed anyone, but if we have, we certainly apologize.”


The Holy Trinity Church congregation would like to thank everyone who came out to help, all of their guests who collected a dinner, and the Codroy Valley Fire Department, who allowed them to use the hall to prepare and distribute the meals.


“We’d like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, and God bless.”",

  subtitles: "Jadian Hibbs-Blackmore in summer 2020. – submitted",
  body: "adian Hibbs-Blackmore’s love of woodcrafts dates back to his childhood, when he lived near the woods and would wander in to find something to whittle with a little knife.


“I had great influence from one of my family members, who are all woodworkers and in the trade,” says Jadian. “It really, really took off when I was about 13. I started making a lot of spoons and a lot of other furniture items.”


Tables, chairs, shelves and bookcases are among Jadian’s repertoire. He’s had formal training, having completed the Cabinetmaker program at the College of the North Atlantic’s Port aux Basques campus last year.


“I learned all the fine millwork,” says Jadian. “All the fine detail.”


He hopes to make woodworking part of his career path, but Jadian isn’t ready to hang up a sign just yet. He’s just finishing up the first semester of a two year program to become an agriculture technician.


“One day I’d like to have my own farm and my own woodshop.”


The dream is to eventually settle in the Codroy Valley, keep livestock, grow crops and build in a responsible and eco-friendly manner.


“It’s good soil up there and a good climate to grow in,” says Jadian. “What I’ve always kind of wanted on my farm is a no-kill farm, a vegan farm I guess you’d say. So we’re not necessarily killing the animals, we’re just using their byproducts and letting the animals live their lives.”


Jadian is part of the younger generation that the provincial government’s agriculture programs have been targeting. In order to deal with the problem of long-term food sustainability, the province has been dropping various incentives to draw fledgling entrepreneurs to an industry that has been struggling to attract them for years.

There are students of different ages in his class, and Jadian says food sustainability is a key component of the program.


“That is a big issue. That’s one of the main topics that we talk about is developing farms within the province so we don’t have to depend on other places for food.”


Responsible farming is also part of the curriculum. Whereas farming used to be mostly generational knowledge handed down from parent to child, there’s a lot more information for prospective farmers to avail of as technology has continued to improve.


“What happened in the 30s with the Great Dust Bowl, that was all just over tillage and no nutrient management, and they weren’t really caring for the soil.”


While he continues his studies, Jadian carves spoons and walking sticks, which he sells online. He will even fill custom design orders if he can.


“It is a little bit more fine work, but I do a couple of things on my own just for practice.”


Jadian makes two different sizes of spoons, which are meant to be both practical cooking utensils but also attractive and unique enough to serve as a show piece. With Christmas almost here, he’s had plenty of orders to fill.


“I’ve been making spoons pretty much every day.”


Like many artists, Jadian can be particular when it comes to the raw materials he uses, assessing grains and textures before selecting a particular piece of wood. He likes to stick to hard wood, and he sources most of it in the Codroy Valley.


“Whatever wood I take, I also re-plant back,” says Jadian. “I think my favourite to carve with is birch because it’s got really a crispy texture, and you can slide the knife right through it, and it makes a nice, clean slice.”


The one he finds most visually appealing is cherry.


“You get your darker reds, lighter reds, purples and browns. Really beautiful.”


It takes him about an hour or so to craft a spoon. The smaller ones, less than six inches in length, usually go for about $5 and the larger ones, up to a foot long, tend to go for $10.


“I just put a lot of extra work into things that you would probably use to eat with,” says Jadian. “I love it.”",

And all through the town

I’ve been doing my best

To make you all frown


But you giggle and cheer

Mouths agape, eyes agog

Whenever I appear

Somewhere with my dog


I went to Colemans

To buy some Who Hash

But the shoppers all laughed

So I dashed past the cash


I went to the post office

To mail Santa a letter

I begged him “Stay home

So I can feel better.”


But the clerks took my photo

And praised my quick trip

When all that I wanted

Was to warn off St. Nick


I went to the schools

Where the kiddies all play

And study together

In their classrooms all day


But Max seems to love them

And this just won’t do

He’s the Grinch’s best buddy

He can’t like the Whos!


We jumped in my car

And drove back to town

Where people beeped horns

Their smiles brought me down

I made it back home

I jumped in my bed

Yanked the covers up over

My fuzzy green head


As the darkness sets in

Christmas lights shine bright

And well wishers pass by

Wishing holiday delights


Even Max will forsake me

For the kiddies he meets

Who rub, squeeze and kiss him

And sneak him sweet treats


But my home is my castle

And if Santa comes in

I’ll yank the hair off of

His chinny chin chin


I’ll steal all of the presents

From that garish red sleigh

And hide them away

‘Til the cold light of day


I’ll stop Christmas from coming

Some way, somehow

And when I’ve succeeded

I’ll take my long bow


You can thank me by keeping

Your songs to yourself

And those silly red elves

Up high on their shelves


Stop petting my dog

Stop smiling my way

It’s time to change Christmas

Into a Grinch holiday!


The Grinch absolutely refuses to grow his tiny, cold heart three sizes too big and much prefers it two sizes too small. He lives on Mount Crumpit with his trusty dog, Max, who is much stronger than a team of eight reindeer (nine if you count Rudolph) and can pull a sleigh all by himself! When he’s not Grinching, he likes to eat cans of Who Hash and plot ways to keep Christmas from coming.

“From a Distance” may you celebrate the blessings of another Christmas Season with laughter, great food, and the joys of family, friends and community.


We must recognize the pandemic that has wreaked pain and heartache on thousands of Canadians has not gone away. However, the renewed hope of the distribution of a vaccine for COVID-19 in the New Year does bring good tidings. 

These times have not been easy on anyone. Families divided by distance, restrictions on travel, limits on contacts, job losses, masks, isolation and communities torn have impacted us all in some way. The journey has not ended. 


Our wonderful town has collectively demonstrated our strength to adapt to a new normal of living with the virus. Residents must continue looking after each other by following Public Health Guidelines. Distancing, masking, good hygiene, and isolation does work in keeping us safe. Keeping our personal, family and community bubbles in tack will allow us to enjoy a most wonderful holiday season. And, it goes without saying, “No mummers ‘llowed in.” 


Let’s bring in 2021 with the enthusiasm of renewed hope.


Happy New Year!

  body: "EDMONTON, AB – I’m sitting at home, self-isolating in my bedroom waiting to go to the Expo centre to get tested. Sore throat.  


Meanwhile, my work family is carrying on. Our 8-bed ICU at the Grey Nuns Hospital now has 17 patients. Read that again. Most of the RNs are taking care of two patients each. Having the usual 1:1 care is impossible. We work in teams, making our way down the hallways proning and unproning the sickest patients on ventilators. The ventilators are often ‘maxed’ out - the highest settings of oxygen percentage, the highest pressures. The Respiratory Therapists are absolutely running their butts off to maintain all of those ventilators.


We work together, with them often staying in the isolation rooms to help turn our patients, hold an iPad so families can see their loved ones, who are most often paralyzed in a medically induced coma so they cannot fight what the ventilator needs to do. Medications run constantly through large IVs to keep their hearts beating somewhat normally and their blood pressures high enough to oxygenate major organs. 


We are exhausted, heartbroken, making phone calls that we hate, crying with patients and in our break room crying some more. We can’t hug each other or offer that kind of support when one of our work people has to turn off the life-support that they probably helped turn on a few weeks ago.


We get to know our patients loved ones who call multiple times a day – we’re on a first name basis. We do our absolute best to take their calls or call them back as quick as we can. No one can visit. That is absolutely killing us. Watching someone’s mother, father, uncle, sister, daughter, son, etc., struggling to fight and very often, not winning. 


This isn’t about wearing masks or staying at home. This is about what it’s like in your hospitals. The emergency departments are doing their best to control their environments so that everyone who needs care, gets care. But I’m telling you right now, we are at the cusp of change. For the worst.


Soon our ‘ICU’ will spill over into our recovery room as they have done in other hospitals in our city. AHS is looking at giving the ICU Nurses THREE patients! THREE each – all of them requiring life support and multiple modalities of care that only ICU trained nurses can administer.


What happens to other patients needing major, emergency surgery requiring an ICU bed post operatively? The elderly man with severe pancreatitis? The overdoses and suicide attempts? Questions my work family hold at the backs of their minds all the time. Our doctors will have to make decisions. The hardest decisions they’ve ever had to make. 


Thank goodness for all of the extra staff who have been redeployed/reassigned to help us. We would not be able to do this without them. Seriously. They replenish supplies for us, they help us turn, reposition, prone/unprone, wash and change our patients. They bring and mix meds, answer phone calls, watch the monitors while we sneak away to the bathroom to pee after holding it for too long. They are priceless to us. RNs, LPNs, HCAs, from medicine, surgery, recovery, the OR, emergency. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. 


Our unit looks like a war zone. 


There are carts of supplies everywhere. Hallways are super crowded. It’s noisy. Because we’re all talking, yelling to be heard through masks and face shields. Monitors and alarms sing their songs constantly. Ventilators alarm continuously. We move quickly. All three phone lines ringing off the hook. Doctors everywhere. Pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurse practitioners.


Our PPE suppliers keep changing. I’ve had to refit healthcare workers for new N95 masks because we run out of certain sizes. At one point, the nurses were wearing pillow cases on their heads because we ran out of hair caps. They took it in stride, making jokes about it because that’s how we cope.


I, for one, wore a blue bootie on my head every time I went into an isolation room. AHS is doing the best they can. I believe that. They can only do so much with what they’ve been given by our provincial government. 


This (Facebook) post today (Friday, Dec. 11) was meant to paint a picture. Please don’t feel scared because we’re healthcare workers. Please don’t alienate us because of your fear.


Trust me, we don’t go far once we get home to our families. We are not the ones going to the malls or having people over for drinks. We buy groceries online, shop online and only go out if we absolutely need to. Honestly I feel that we’re more protected at work than in the general public. If you know a healthcare worker, please reach out to them. Offer to pick up their groceries, write them an actual letter and post it, send them an uplifting book, text them, video chat, have a weekly check in, whatever. We are all dealing with this in some way. 


I love all of my work family so much. We, are truly in this together. Stay strong my family, stay healthy, find the joy.

ARIES (Mar. 21 - Apr. 20)

It’s best not to discuss your personal life with others. You are able to make favourable changes in your home. Be careful that you don’t spend too much time with a person belonging to someone else. Residential moves will be in your best interest.




TAURUS (Apr. 21 - May 20)

It’s best to listen for the time being. Don’t overspend on items for your home. Real estate investments could be prosperous. Problems with peers are apparent. The struggle is real but will not last forever. 


GEMINI (May 21 - June 21)

You’ve been a little down and you need a lift. Your willingness to help others can and will lead to fatigue if you don’t learn to say no. You will be able to pick up on future trends if you keep your eyes peeled for unique ideas. You can pick up some overtime this week. 


CANCER (June 22 - July 22)

It’s best not to confront situations that deal with in-laws or relatives. Direct your energy wisely. Try looking into new ways to make extra money. Lowered vitality could affect your work. 


LEO (July 23 -Aug. 22)

Nagging has never been something that you could tolerate, and once again it’s driving you into a lonely state of affairs. Do not let them in on your plans if you want things to run smoothly. Your contributions will be valued and helpful. Double check your work and be sure that your boss is in a good mood before making any presentations.


VIRGO (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22)

Make sure that you have all the pertinent information before making any moves. Look into costs, but don’t try to get backing yet. Travel will be on your mind but be careful and proceed with caution to avoid delays. Offer friends commitment or promise that will help stabilize your personal life


LIBRA (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22)

Look into real estate. Social activities that involve the whole family will be enjoyable. Travel will be enticing. Consider a cruise. Uncertain get-rich quick schemes will not be as lucrative as you anticipate. 


SCORPIO (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21)

Don’t torment yourself. Disharmony at home will be extremely stressful. Problems with large corporations or institutions are apparent. Go out with friends and avoid the situation at home. You can learn valuable information if you listen and observe what others are doing and saying.


SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22 - Dec. 20)

You’ll be tempted to spend extravagantly this week. Be prepared to lose friends or alienate loved ones due to your stubborn nature lately. Focus on your own future. Abstain from getting involved with married individuals.


CAPRICORN (Dec. 21 - Jan. 19)

Make sure all of your travel and driver’s documents are in proper order. You should look into a healthier diet. Catch up on correspondence. You should get out and meet new people this week. Every day is a holiday!


AQUARIUS (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18)

Don’t go overboard; start small and work toward building things up slowly. Make plans to mix business with pleasure. Dinner with clients or business associates should be successful. A change of attitude has probably disrupted your home life. Dig deep to find out how costly a new venture will be before you sign on the dotted line. 


PISCES (Feb. 19 - Mar. 20)

Tone down and put some of that hard earned cash into a safe, long-term investment. Doing odd jobs around the house will be successful and appreciated. You could find yourself left with someone’s dirty laundry though. Check for problems with appliances, water, or electricity in your home.",

Those were the good old days when cars were big as boats and if you weren’t careful your fingers would stick to the chrome bumpers. Some drivers used to put up with it, if not outright expect it. Others weren’t as keen.


“How many times did the drivers stop and get out and try to chase us, and we’d take off. When they’d get back in the car we’d be back there again!”


Usually Donna would grab on to a car’s bumper up near the Esso, now Spencer’s Garage, and on a good run she could get dragged around almost the entirety of East End Channel, from the ‘bottom road’ (Water Street East) to the ‘top road’ (Legallais Street). She’d go down latched on to one vehicle and come back up the hill hanging on to another one.


“All you had to hope for was that there was no raw pavement,” laughs Donna, who admits she hit raw pavement and went tumbling more than she likes to recall.


One of her friends broke his leg out near Suzie Parsons’ house at corner of Lillington Avenue. When he fell the car ran over his leg. Donna never got hurt that badly, but she did keep running into trouble because of bumper shining.


“Do you know how many pairs of mitts I lost?” she asks rhetorically. “My mother was crazy with me. ‘Don’t you come home tonight with n’ar mitt!’ she used to say. They’d freeze on to the bumper.”


Donna figures she lost at least one mitten from almost every pair she ever had growing up.

At least one time too many kids latched on to a car at once.


“We tore the bumper off this old Volkswagen,” chuckles Donna. 


The driver was furious but failed to catch the children. It was all good fun for Donna and her friends.


Other than the mittens she had no problems keeping the nature of her winter fun hidden from her parents. She might have gotten scolded about the mittens, but she’s pretty sure she never got in trouble for the bumper shining.

  body: "CAPE RAY – Residents of Cape Ray were lucky enough to be treated to a bit of holiday spirit in the form of Christmas carols last Saturday, Dec. 19.


A group of young ladies went around the community during the prolonged power outage to croon some festive holiday tunes to their friends, family and teachers, says Cathy Furlong.


“They started by decorating their Christmas mobile, including a light up tree on the top,” said Furlong.


The ladies sang for almost three hours and covered a wide variety of songs. Their repertoire included everything from old favourites like Deck The Halls, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Winter Wonderland to the more tongue-in-cheek favourites such as All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth and I’m Getting Nothing For Christmas.


Given the smiles of everyone involved, that last one at least seems rather unlikely.


“They had a lot of fun spreading Christmas cheer around the community,” noted Furlong",

  body: "MARGAREE - FOX ROOST – If there’s anyone who can make The Grinch behave, it’s Santa Claus. On Sunday, Dec. 20 when Santa paid a pre-Christmas visit, he invited the Grinch along for a ride in the fire truck.


Even the Grinch couldn’t seem to refuse Santa, and brought along his little dog, Max. While Santa rode around in his sleigh, the Grinch stayed under close watch in the pumper truck during the visit lest he get up to no good.


The Grinch seemed happy to greet children while Santa did some early gift giving in partnership with the ACW and the Margaree-Fox Roost Volunteer Fire Department.


“The ACW has got fruit baskets done up and we’ll deliver them to the seniors, and along the way we’ll see the children and we’ve got candy canes for them,” said Santa.


Carolann Keough, who volunteers with both the ACW and the fire department, said that the group had 37 double plates and 31 single plates prepared, and estimated that Santa would deliver over 100 plates during the visit.


“It’s not just seniors,” clarified Keough. “It’s people with disabilities and shut ins. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a senior.”


While Santa did his gift giving, children chased the fire truck around hoping to see the Grinch.


“They want us to keep him,” noted Keough at one point.


Despite their best efforts, the slippery Grinch and his dog, Max, got away from the firefighters and Santa to return to Mount Crumpet.  He was last spotted on Christmas Eve, warning people to avoid Christmas. The Grinch doesn’t seem eager to take his own advice though. He was spotted posing happily for photos several times. Could it be that Santa’s influence has rubbed off on him?


“I just like the attention!” he grinched.",

  body: "There’s a line by the Counting Crows in their song, Long December: 


A long December and there’s reason to believe

Maybe this year will be better than the last...”


Personally I feel like December has shot by like it got fired out of a cannon, and 2021 is already shaping up to be more of the same.


Pandemic! Recession! CERB, non-maskers, anti-vaxxers and those who come from away and those who work away and come home.


I rarely turn on the news anymore. My ability to process any of it is so far into the red zone that I am left sarcastic and/or sad for hours after the evening newscast. My aversion is hardly unique, but its a bit trickier given that I make my living as a journalist. There’s a bit of refuge in my brand of journalism, though.


Municipal politics are a lot less likely to provoke mass protests against COVID-19 restrictions, for example. Our hard hitting news largely boils down to council recaps and the court report, and honestly that’s plenty.


We live in interesting times – a global pandemic that has fundamentally altered the every day for everyone – even in our relatively unscathed region.


People are adjusting, and in so doing provide kernels of wisdom. There’s a gardener in Rose Blanche who offered some How To advice about growing your own vegetables in a sometimes hostile climate, and if that sounds like a silly topic for a story, then one only has to take a look at the grocery store prices to appreciate that food sustainability is nothing to dismiss offhand because, “nothing will grow here”.


Plenty grows here, including artists. There’s an overabundance of musical talent in the Southwest Coast that goes unfairly recognized, to say nothing of the crafters and artists who routinely donate their talents and hard work to help support their community.


These are the stories I like writing and reading. In 100 years it’s your face and an article about your achievement or life they will be researching. These are the stories that matter in the future, but especially now.


They provide a much needed mental and emotional break from the stress of the constant bombardment about provincial, federal or American politics that dominate the mainstream news cycle.


I’ve got a political science degree that I can’t be bothered to hang on my wall. Politics, in my personal opinion, is currently little more than a cesspit of self-interest and big business priorities, and has served to tear apart families and friends in a way that didn’t seem possible before 2020.


Indeed, before the advent of social media it seems unlikely that people would be so dismissive about the health, well-being and very lives of their friends and neighbours. Pundits can and do blame social media for it, but I offer this – Facebook, Twitter and the other popular platforms aren’t writing those words underneath the profile photos – people are.


As a journalist I do my best to try to remain neutral. Personally I have no patience but professionally I must. Sometimes there have been massive cuts to my raw articles, and that tends to trigger some passionate debates.


I don’t get to write what I want, when I want just because I am a co-owner. There’s an accountability to journalism that all the “fake news” criers always like to ignore or dismiss.

Whatever goes into this paper I have to get past two full partners (one of whom is an editor) and an unofficial silent one. It’s not the New York Times or the Washington Post, but there are checks and balances in place even in small town Newfoundland.


Most importantly, I am accountable to the people who entrust me with their stories and the public who spend their hard earned money to read them. And read them you do.


The Wreckhouse Weekly enjoys a dedicated readership that continues to slowly grow. We’ve got some savvy columnists, regular letter writers and community contributors like the Port aux Basques Minor Hockey Association that help record our triumphs and legacy.


There are Halloween and Christmas kiddies, stories of charitable endeavours and featured profiles by guest writers.


“I can’t really write,” one guest columnist told me, before writing a beautiful feature that proved otherwise.


It has been a fairly short sample size, but I do know that there are plenty of natural writers in this region who scoff at the notion they can string a sentence or two together. It’s as amusing and endearing as it is frustrating. 


We have many talents here on the Southwest coast of a rocky, windswept island in the North Atlantic. We have our traditions and our own way of doing things, and that gives us a solid foundation to take on anything the world and life may throw at us next.


Whatever 2021 brings us, I hope that at least on one front it truly is just more of the same – more you.",

  body: "Although we have only been publishing your stories since Aug. 10, even in that short span of time we’ve shared some pretty interesting stories. It was still quite difficult to choose, a solid testament to the sometimes overlooked but no less compelling stories of more rural life.


It seems we’re not alone in thinking that our region’s stories are important. One of our most common requests, even after less than a half year of publication, is access to some of our first editions. In particular, new mail subscribers living and working out of province will ask for back copies, looking for news of home.


With that in mind, we’ve selected our favourite Wreckhouse stories so far. In this week’s edition, we’ve also popped in some of the Traditions stories, although if you want recipes about how to make Christmas Potted Meat you’re going to have to buy the cookbook.

From talented artists to touching tributes to harder news, the Wreckhouse Weekly has endeavoured to provide a glimpse into our tiny corner of the world. Most of it you may be aware of, but there may just be one or two that slid under your radar.


So without further ado, here are the Top 10 stories we published and throughly enjoyed this year, in no particular order. Did yours make the list? What one did we forget? Tell us!


1. Music Row featuring Gordon Cormier.

(Vol. 1, Issue 1, Aug. 10)


Our very first Music Row column is likely to always remain one of our top favourites.

Codroy Valley musician Gordon Cormier not only sat down with editor J. René Roy to discuss his storied musical career, he was the one who reached out to suggest the idea for a regular music column in the first place!


Thanks to Cormier’s initial suggestion, we’ve also published columns on local artists, seniors and even a Meet Your Neighbour feature. Did you know that when he was only four or five years old that Cormier used to perform onstage at the Chignic Lodge? Gordon has performed as a solo artist and as a member of the Cormiers, an award-winning family musical group. His great uncle was Johnny Archie MacDonald and his niece, Mallory Johnson, has found success in country music’s famed Nashville scene. Musical talent runs in the blood for the Cormier clan.


Gordon still performs live on Facebook on Saturday nights, and he’s even hosted a virtual jamboree. His current group, the Breeze Band, played at the 2019 Deer Lake Strawberry Festival.


2. Rennie bible comes home to Cape Ray.

(Vol. 1, Issue 5, Sept. 7)


Even if you’re not particularly devout, it’s hard not to be impressed by the Rennie family bible. The gold embossed, red leather bible is filled with black and white and full colour engravings that evoke Renaissance paintings, full of light and vividly etched detail. Printed in 1892, the bible has seen its fair share of wear and tear but is still a treat for historians, art lovers and locals alike.


Originally stored at The Rooms in St. John’s, the Rennie bible has been placed on display at the Cape Ray Lighthouse Museum and Crafts. The move was prompted by Caroline Taylor, great-granddaughter of Robert Rennie, the first lightkeeper stationed at Cape Ray in its original wooden lighthouse back in 1871.


In addition to the bible, the Cape Ray Lighthouse Museum also shares photos of the Rennie family and delves into their history, as well as the history of the lightkeepers who followed.

“We’d like to have it in its proper place, where he lived,” said Anne Osmond, Chairperson for the Cape Ray Lighthouse Keepers Committee.


3. Remembering an icon: Jim Hayward.

(Vol. 1, Issue 6, Sept. 14)


Loss is never easy, and writing tributes of remembrance for public consumption that extend beyond the traditional obituary can be very painful. Stepping outside his role as MHA for Burgeo-La Poile, Andrew Parsons penned a touching memorial to his old hockey coach, Jim Hayward.


Hayward’s legacy lies not in the coaching itself, but rather in all of the players he coached, his words still echoing in their ears decades after they hung up their skates. Like youth sport coaches everywhere, he helped shape the adults his players eventually grew to be.

“If there were to be a Mount Rushmore of local hockey figures, he would undoubtedly be one of the prominent figures in this sculpture,” wrote Parsons.


4. Outfitters struggles impact region.

(Vol. 1, Issue 8, Sept. 28)


The fiscal realities of COVID-19 continue to reverberate around the globe, and while the Southwest Coast has not yet registered a single case, that is not to say the region as a whole isn’t being hit hard. Small businesses, the backbone of any economy, have moved beyond suffering and into financial ruin thanks to the mandated shutdowns.


Mountain Top Outfitters and the Silver Sands Restaurant, owned and operated by Arthur and Debbie Ryan, are among those trying to stay afloat. They’ve gotten creative and re-targeted clients or accommodated those they could, but the couple fears that it may take years to rebuild their business – if and when the pandemic recedes. Compounding the situation is that because the outfitter and restaurant are so closely tied to other businesses in the Codroy Valley, the ripple effect has been exacerbated.


“I don’t know. I just take it a day at a time,” said Arthur.


5. Saving St. James Anglican Church.

(Vol. 1, Issue 10, Oct. 12)


How do you save a historic church that needs repairs too costly for an increasingly smaller congregation, especially when scheduled worship services must adjust to compensate for pandemic protocols? That is one of the larger problems facing Rev. Jane Allen of St. James Anglican Church in Port aux Basques.


Over one hundred years of the town’s history can be tied to St. James, and that’s about as old as the building itself is. If the town shows no sign of aging, the same can’t be said true of the church.


Repairing the prominent towers alone cost over $30,000 and the exterior and the roof will cost even more. Overhauling the church will keep it standing for another 50 or 60 years, assuming the funds can be raised. Letting it fall to ruin is simply not an option.


“It’s a landmark. Our church is a landmark,” said Allen. “You can see it whichever way you come. My father used to use it as a marker when he was out fishing.”




6. Accidental archaeology.

(Vol. 1, Issue 13, Nov. 2)


Who doesn’t like finding buried treasure? Of course ‘treasure’ might be too generous a word, given that all First Choice Convenience owner Jeannette Tobin found was a long-forgotten basement.


Chasing a water leak, the excavator instead unearthed a basement beneath the store’s driveway. Inside was a lot of canvas, wood, rubble and a crushed orange and brown Frostie Root Beer soda can. Had it been intact, Tobin could have sold it for about $11 on e-Bay.

After much discussion, a trip or two down memory lane, and a hefty assist from the Southwest Coast Historical Society, it seems likely that the basement belonged to an old barber shop.


“We never knew it was there. We’ve been walking on it all along,” said Tobin.


7. A mother’s love.

(Vol. 1, Issue 14, Nov. 9)


So much of life is unkind or unfair, yet people continue to find grace and beauty despite the hardships. Jackiee Sweet’s story of young mother Brittany Gaudet’s struggle to help her daughter, Jersey, battle Battens disease, offered insight into strength and courage to cope with the unthinkable.


Gaudet lost one child to Battens disease, her beloved Ava. Then she learned she would have to battle for Jersey too. That means regular, bi-weekly 10 hour drives for medical treatment and a steady stream of doctors, nurses and sleepless nights. It takes an egregious toll that very few can ever truly understand, but Gaudet shows no sign of fatigue or surrender.


“The sky is the limit for my kids. I won’t stop until I an do all I can for them,” promised Gaudet.


8. Poor cell service impacts 911 response.

(Vol. 1, Issue 17, Nov. 30)


Imagine you have an accident somewhere on a road along the Southwest Coast – even the Trans Canada Highway, that main artery that runs the breadth of the world’s second largest country. But you can’t call for help, and anyone who stops to render aid will have to leave you, alone and bleeding, just to call 911.


It’s 2020 and everyone has a cell phone, but not everyone has service. Those dropped cell signals are commonplace around the province. First responders, politicians and even the service providers are trying to fix it, so what’s the hold up? Is it really all about money?


“Times are changing, and people are moving from landlines to cell phones and that’s not always a benefit to first responders,” says RCMP Cpl. Colin Helm of the Port aux Basques detachment.


9. Silent witness: Arrow Air Flight 1285.

(Vol. 1, Issue 19, Dec. 14)


Listening to retired RCMP officer Bob Hinks talk about his experience in the aftermath of the Arrow Air Flight 1285 plane crash sends chills down the spine. For Hinks, meanwhile, chills would be an improvement. He suffers from PTSD. Decades later he can still detail the sights, sounds, smells of that day and just discussing it can result in a bad day, a bad night.


Hinks was among the first to respond to the McDonnell Douglas DC-8 wreckage. The flight, carrying 256 souls, crashed shortly after takeoff from Gander on Dec. 12, 1985 and remains the deadliest crash in Canadian history and the U.S. Army’s single deadliest peacetime air disaster. 


“He was just sitting there, and I asked him, ‘Are you okay?’ And he was dead,” recounted Hinks.




10. Grinch sightings increase.

(Vol. 1, Issue 20, Dec. 21)


Call us biased. We’re enjoying The Grinch as much as everyone else is.


From taunting school children to snarking at seniors, attempting to steal ornaments, wreck trees or swipe Christmas dinners, the Grinch has helped spread some silliness with his antics.


Were you lucky enough to spot him with his little dog, Max, or were you one of the poor motorists forced to wait while he halted traffic so he could swagger his way across the street?",

  body: "COAL BROOK – During the prolonged power outage that hit most of the Southwest Coast on Saturday, Dec. 19, the Channel-Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department responded to to a single vehicle accident at Coal Brook, South Branch.


The call, which involved a tractor-trailer, came in at around 7:45 p.m. and seven members of the department responded. The Jaws of Life were necessary to extract the transport driver, who had become trapped in the wreckage. Members of the RCMP, the Codroy Valley Fire Department and the ambulance service also responded to the accident scene.


“The tractor-trailer was off the road and the driver was still trapped inside the wrecked vehicle. Upon arrival we set up our scene lighting and starting cutting through the metal using the Jaws of Life,” stated Fire Chief Jerry Musseau via e-mail.


Musseau stated that there was a huge amount of mangled metal and it took the fire department approximately 30 or 40 minutes to cut through some of the debris to extract the driver. The driver remained conscious, although bloodied and scratched, and blood was visible on the inside of the vehicle, reported Musseau. Once the driver was removed from the demolished truck he was transported by the ambulance service to the Dr. Charles L. LeGrow Medical Centre in Port aux Basques. 


“At the time road and weather conditions were good but the truck was demolished,” observed Musseau. “It was my understanding the driver did survive the accident and may still be in hospital at Port aux Basques.”

  body: "During Christmas season of 1873, the people of Rose Blanche got what they had been asking for, for years, when the final lamp fitting for the Rose Blanche Lighthouse was completed on December 31st .


After several years of complaints, a petition to the government from P. H. Sorsoliel (the postmaster at the time) and residents of Rose Blanche, and advocacy for a light in Rose Blanche from J. T. Neville (Inspector of Lighthouses and Public Works), the Newfoundland government approved the project.


Considerable care was taken in planning the project; Neville pushed for longevity in project planning during his career as Inspector, and the Rose Blanche lighthouse was no exception. In fact, he was the one who recommended a cast-iron light tower for Channel Head – a light that has been in operation since 1895.


For the lighthouse further down the coast, he also wanted to follow a new plan he was implementing in public works throughout Newfoundland – he wanted to build it primarily from materials sourced from Newfoundland.


The first lighthouse built with this model was on Puffin Island, off the Northwest coast of the Avalon peninsula. The second was the Rose Blanche lighthouse.


Granite was quarried on the spot, the lumber came from local mills, and the roofing slates came from either Trinity Bay or Green Bay, many of which were reclaimed during the reconstruction project in the 1990s.


Construction began in 1872, with the bulk completed in the summer of 1873. The final light fitting was completed December 31, 1873 – a high quality light from David and Thomas Stevenson of Edinburgh, Scotland. The first light keeper, John A. Roberts, lit it for the first time on January 1st , 1874, well in time for Old Christmas Day.
