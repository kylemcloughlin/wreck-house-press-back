  body: "(NC) Cybercriminals are always on the lookout for people from whom they can steal information, money or identities. Here are the top cyber threats you need to be aware of to keep yourself safe.


Scam messages

These are fake messages that try to trick you into giving up your time, money or information. Also known as phishing messages, they are typically sent as fake emails or texts designed to look authentic. Their goal is to trick you into giving them information by asking you to update, validate or confirm your account.

Some red flags to look for include spelling or grammar mistakes, as well as an unprofessional design or poor formatting. The messages may also seem official by referencing fake government departments, or they may be intimidating and threaten you with legal action.

 It is a best practice to verify whether the sender’s email address is legitimate. When in doubt, contact the organization the sender is claiming to represent through an official channel before giving away personal information.


Downloads

Downloading from the internet and sharing files are common, everyday practices that bring risks to you and your devices. If you aren’t careful or responsible, you risk downloading viruses, malware and spyware disguised as a popular movie or song to your computer or phone. To protect yourself, only download files from legitimate, trusted websites, app stores, or better yet, directly from the source of the files.




Hackers 

Hackers will try to gain unauthorized access to your devices by finding weaknesses or faults in your security settings and exploit them to access your information. Protect yourself from these malicious attacks with a passphrase or complex password and multi-factor authentication. For example, use facial recognition in combination with a pass code for your phone. You should also enable automatic updates for your software and operating system whenever possible.

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The RCMP and the Fire Department continue to deal with the ongoing rash of prank calls. The calls began over the summer but slacked off in the fall before resuming on Dec. 20. Within a three day span, the Fire Department received a total of nine prank calls, prompting a strategy meeting by first responders.


“I have met with the RCMP and a Bell Aliant representative,” confirmed Fire Chief Jerry Musseau via e-mail. “This is being investigated.”


Musseau declined to go into detail while the RCMP attempts to track down the prankster, but did write that, “I have another option in mind that I can temporarily use to deal with these calls should this continue, however I am hoping the RCMP can get to the bottom of this soon.”


Prank calls to emergency services, also called swatting, largely gained traction in the 1970s with calls to airlines and schools about bomb threats. With the growth of the internet and easy access to online tools to disguise a caller’s information and location, swatting has become increasingly sophisticated.


But what was once considered a harmless prank has become enough of a threat that in the United States advocates are calling for it to be treated as terrorism due to its intimidation factor that has led to injury or death.


In California, swatters are liable for all damages related to a hoax call, plus fines of up to $10,000. A swatter was sentenced in March 2019 to 20 years imprisonment after his hoax call led to someone’s death.


Canada has also been tracking and charging swatters. In 2014, four teens from Ontario, Québec and British Columbia were charged with public mischief and even extortion after hoax calling emergency services across North America.


Public mischief may sound harmless, but it carries with it a very real prison sentence of up to five years.


Calling a fire department to a false scene that consequently delays a response to an actual emergency may cost big money, not just freedom. Insurance companies can sue hoaxsters to recover damages the insurer has been obligated to pay out after emergency responders have breached entry because of a prank call.


Psychologists have listed numerous causes for prank calls, from peer pressure to boredom to underlying socio-pathology or mental disorders. Whatever the reason, it’s hardly a joke to the firefighters says Musseau.


“The hoax is not only a nuisance, but is also dangerous. I recommend all parents talk to all members of their household to emphasize the seriousness of these prank calls made to the Fire Department. I just hope that we are not responding to a prank call and a real emergency occurs.”",

I have to express a huge thank you to Mr. Grinch.


On Sunday, Dec. 20, Mr. Grinch and Santa helped the ACW and Fire Department to deliver fruit trays to the seniors, shut ins and the sick.


The adults and the kids got so much joy and laughter when times are a little sad. I know that Mr. Grinch will read about all the kind words that the people on the Southwest Coast are saying, because all papers get tossed and goes directly to Mt. Crumpit.


So Mr. Grinch, until next year, please stay safe and hopefully next year we will see and enjoy your presence again. Thank you from the ACW, Fire Department and citizens of Margaree-Fox Roost.


He gave us what Christmas is about – maybe Christmas doesn’t come from a store, maybe Christmas means a little bit more. The unity that he gave was unique and gave people hope, love and laughter.

  subtitles: "Karlee’s parents, John MacDonald and Jennifer Taylor, watched via Facetime as their 4-year-old daughter opened her gifts on Christmas morning. - courtesy of Jenn Taylor",
  body: "NORTH RIVER – Shortly before reporting to work on Christmas morning, Jennifer Taylor used her cell phone to watch her 4-year-old daughter open some presents. Across the country from his worksite in Alberta, John MacDonald, also watched the unwrapping via Facetime.


MacDonald, who is originally from Port aux Basques, is a rotational worker and Taylor, who hails from Cupids, is a personal care assistant. While Taylor was scheduled to work, MacDonald had chosen to remain in Alberta to protect his family, especially his daughter.


“Her name is Karlee and she has a heart condition,” explained Taylor via telephone interview on Tuesday, Dec. 29.


MacDonald typically works for 21 days in Alberta, then returns home to his family for 14 days.


“He would come home. On Day 5 he would get his testing, and then by Day 7 he would be allowed out and he’d be able to live a normal life for those seven days. But it was still a challenge for us.”


Because of Karlee’s condition, her parents exceeded provincial protocols right from the outset. For example, while he could have isolated with his family, MacDonald always isolated separately and would only join them after receiving medical clearance.


“He was typically gone for four weeks really, and Karlee would only see him for one week,” notes Taylor.


Once the second wave of COVID-19 began to sweep the country and provinces began adjusting their protocols, Taylor and MacDonald decided to start the holiday season a bit early just in case.


“His last rotation – he was flying back December 1st – so we took a few pictures and did a pretend Christmas, we’ll say. We didn’t open up any gifts because we still had it in the back of our heads that he might get home for Christmas.”


After MacDonald returned to work in Alberta, he learned that an outbreak had been declared. Meanwhile, Newfoundland and Labrador re-implemented the mandatory 14-day quarantine period. That meant that once MacDonald returned, he would have to spend the entirety of his visit separated from his family instead of only half of it.


“He wouldn’t see Karlee, and with her being so young and not really understanding, we don’t do window visits,” said Taylor. “Now we don’t know when we’re going to see him.”


Because there’s no point in coming home just to isolate until he returns to work, MacDonald has chosen to remain in Alberta.


“His company has allowed him to work some overtime and work some different shifts until he can build up some time where he can, hopefully, come home for four or five weeks, where he can do his two-week isolation period alone, and then still get some time with Karlee,” said Taylor.


Cognizant that there is an outbreak at the huge camp where he works just north of Fort McMurray, MacDonald is taking every precaution to stay safe.


“You all share a common area – getting your food, laundry rooms. Some dorms have shared showers, so really you have no idea who you’ve been in contact (with) and who might have been in contact with who, and John’s job especially – he’s high risk because he’s a coach bus driver,” explained Taylor.


Taylor is a shift worker for a long-term care home, and is obliged to work every second Christmas. That meant she also couldn’t be home Christmas morning to watch Karlee open her presents.


“My little girl is four going on ninety-four. She’s very smart,” notes Taylor. “In the past, we’ve just delayed Christmas. Like when I worked Christmas, we would just celebrate another day. But she’s of the age now where she’s counting down to Christmas.”


That meant no postponing Christmas this year either. Instead, Taylor left Karlee still asleep under the care of her grandmother and uncle. Once Karlee awoke, Taylor and MacDonald watched a livestream of Karlee’s excitement and joy.


“My mother Facetimed from one phone and my brother Facetimed from another phone, and we watched her open up her main gifts that she was expecting from Santa,” shared Taylor.


Taylor reported to work immediately after, but MacDonald wasn’t scheduled until the afternoon so he stayed on a bit longer. After work, Karlee and Taylor joined their family for Christmas supper before returning home.


“We sat down by the Christmas tree and we videoed John, just myself and Karlee, and then we opened up some gifts because we sent him some gifts in the mail,” notes Taylor. “So our Christmas pictures and Christmas morning pictures were a little different this year.”


Taylor isn’t quite sure if this virtual, pandemic-altered Christmas is harder on Karlee or her parents. Karlee doesn’t understand time yet enough to realize that her father has been gone for an extra week, and her parents haven’t told her that they don’t yet know when he will return. They have told Karlee that MacDonald can’t fly right now because there is a lot of the virus going around and he doesn’t want to get sick.


“She’s very understanding of that. She’ll say, ‘Daddy’s staying to work so I don’t get sick’, but I feel like she does feel the strain of it,” admits Taylor.


Taylor figures MacDonald will be gone for a minimum of 8 weeks, if not longer, depending on how the pandemic continues to unfold.


“It’s not that he has to be (away), he chooses to be, to keep her safe,” said Taylor.


Meanwhile, although she works at a long-term care facility, Taylor doesn’t expect she’ll be able to receive the COVID-19 vaccination to help alleviate the stress somewhat. Right now the vaccine is only being offered to front-line healthcare workers, but Taylor battles severe allergies and the vaccine is currently not compatible with people who need to carry epi-pens.


“It’s probably not a choice for me just yet anyway.”


This is the first time Karlee’s parents have had a virtual Christmas, and Taylor says she hopes it’s the last they have to watch her via video, but she remains practical about the future.


“Things aren’t changing anytime soon, so we just have to do what we gotta do I guess.”


Taylor admits it can be scary at times. Neither one always knows who they are contacting at work, and who those people have been in contact with that may, by extension, unwittingly put them at risk.


“I can only do my part, and John can only do his,” said Taylor. “Realistically, we wear masks and a visitor has to wear a mask. Yes, they say it helps the spread, but it doesn’t prevent it, and it doesn’t absolutely necessarily protect you.”


The family enjoys strong support from their immediate family. Taylor has pulled Karlee from daycare and Taylor’s mother has stepped in as a primary babysitter.


“Our circle is very small. I have three older brothers,” says Taylor. “They help a lot. They help any way they can.”


Taylor says that they’ve received plenty of messages of support on social media from members of their community and far beyond. She knows plenty of other families with rotational workers facing similar difficult choices, and has observed the current backlash against rotational workers.


“They have families they have to provide for, so they need to work too.”


On Christmas Eve, NTV News aired clips from rotational workers for their families back home. Taylor says she and Karlee were holding it together pretty well until MacDonald’s video to them was broadcast.


“He just sent a message that he was going to be away for Christmas, keep his little girl safe, and that he loved her and missed her. She just looked at me and her little eyes just filled up with water, and she said, ‘Mommy, that was the sweetest thing I ever heard’ and she started to cry.”",

  subtitles: "Larry Peckford and his wife have lived in Ottawa for the past 10 years. Dianne LeRiche Peckford was born and educated in Port aux Basques. They have a seasonal residence in the Codroy Valley.


After leaving public service employment, Larry and Dianne had a 6 year stint living in the Northwest Territories. Larry has had a varied career in Newfoundland as a public servant and community volunteer. He is an occasional blogger and writes other pieces of personal interest. You can reach Larry via e-mail at: larrypeckford@outlook.com",
  body: "My last column in the Weekly was titled “From Ottawa with Love” Just for the record, that title was the work of the editors of the newspaper although I have no objection to it. In fact, outside a preference for my home province, deciding to live in Ottawa 10 years ago was a good decision. Maybe it might be worthwhile that I give a bit of background to Ottawa, since it probably has a bit of a reputation that is far different than you think.


Ottawa is a collection of communities that, under an ambitious amalgamation plan in 2001, lumped 11 municipalities together to make Ottawa what it is today. There are mixed reviews on the wisdom of that decision since the physical footprint of the city is huge. Ottawa at 2,796 sq. km is larger than the cities of Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton combined. The city’s total land space is 80% rural in character with many working farms. There are many small communities that are not anything like what you see in a major urban setting. Ottawa is therefore pretty diverse and unique. 


The city of Ottawa, second largest in Ontario and the fourth largest in the country, is a government town and its media can be dominated by its presence. Parts of the city are controlled by a Nation Capital Region (NCR) arrangement that oversees the many government buildings and land in the cities of both Ottawa and Gatineau, Quebec. 


Government agencies, departments and foreign embassies are prominent with many government departments housed in buildings across the Ottawa River in Gatineau. The city of Ottawa is bilingual in character, and bilingualism is a pretty standard requirement if you wish to work here. Some 100,000 public servants work for the federal government, which is about 1 in 5 workers or 20% of Ottawa’s workforce. For many who do not know it, you may be surprised to know Ottawa’s advanced technology sector is one of the largest in North America with an estimated 70,000 jobs.


The typical working patterns of Newfoundlanders over the years saw Toronto and environs as places to work excluded Ottawa as a go-to place for employment. There are lots of us here mainly by virtue of public service employment (and retirement) when transfer from the regions often saw many an aspiring public servant go to Ottawa….but just make sure you are bilingual or ensure that you become so quickly. Unilingual language jobs are in short supply in Ottawa’s federal public service.


City life has its joys even if a furniture purchase may take weeks to deliver or if, in fact, the item has to be made first! Living in Newfoundland the experience is quite different as once an item is purchased delivery is pretty prompt. If you have a truck or that of your neighbour, you took it right away from the store. Waiting for or employing household services can also be mixed. Like anywhere else, the reputation for contractors is best to be checked out thoroughly. Quality and timeliness can be tricky so do your homework and get references. The cheap job is not always the best job.


With my background as a public servant who visited Ottawa often, moving here was not too stressful. Driving in the city is a different story and it took me some time to adjust. I often got the one-finger from an impatient driver who had little tolerance when I went astray. Those polite and compliant public servants can be quite a handful when they are behind the wheel of a car. Maybe the pent-up emotions and constraints of the workplace unleashes an unpleasant side. Look out if someone is unduly held up or they have to make an adjustment out of the ordinary. Dark stares and impatient horn blowing is the result.


All of that said, our experience has been pleasant and when the Ottawa tourism business returns to normal, you may want to come this way and see how much of your tax dollar is spent….museums and attractions galore. There are many who do and I recommend it.",

  subtitles: "Dr. David Thomas is a family physician also serving as the current Chief of Staff for the Dr. Charles L. LeGrow Health Centre in Port aux Basques, which covers the Southwest coast region. Dr. Amy Pieroway is a family physician based in Corner Brook and Chair of the Long Range Family Practice Network.",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Sunday, Jan. 3 marked the 23rd edition of the West Coast NL COVID-19 podcast. Hosted by Dr. David Thomas and Dr. Amy Pieroway, the podcast started on April 19, with the support of Western Health and the Long Range Family Practice Network.


“We’re going to call this one Variances and Vaccines, because those are the questions that we’ve received tonight,” begins Thomas.


Taking questions is pretty much the entire point of hosting these podcasts. Thomas says the goal is to clear up a lot of the misinformation while avoiding any sensationalism that permeates some of the COVID-19 coverage, as well as to bring a local and regional perspective to the discussion.


Like global pandemics, podcasting is also a new challenge for Thomas, though the affable, gregarious doctor seems to be adjusting well on both fronts.


“I do enjoy it, yeah,” said Thomas via phone interview on Wednesday, Jan. 6.


Initially the podcast aired on a weekly basis, but that has been scaled back to the first Sunday of each month at 7:30 p.m. on Facebook. The doctors plan to keep podcasting as long as the communities they serve continue to tune in.


“As long as we keep getting questions and there’s new things coming out about COVID, absolutely, yeah, we’ll keep doing it,” said Thomas. “It’s (COVID) not going away anytime soon, unfortunately.”


Questions stemming from the most recent podcast naturally revolved around the new vaccines. In the beginning, people used to focus more on transmission, symptoms, testing and protocols.


“Every week before doing our podcast we’ll go through all of our questions and we assign them to certain areas, and we figure out which one of us can answer,” said Thomas.

If they don’t know the answer, they will readily admit it and conduct research to share afterwards.


“We’re just reading so much all the time and learning ourselves that we can generally answer the questions we get during the podcast,” notes Thomas, who admits it’s been a steep learning curve for even medical professionals at times.


The only one that’s sort of stumped them questioned the recommended usage of mask filter inserts. A recent question about whether or not the public can stop wearing masks once the vaccines roll out was easier to answer.


“No we can’t, not right away anyway,” Thomas explained. “We’ll have to get up to at least herd immunity and have control over the transmission of the virus before masks are even going to start to go away. I often wonder if masks might be a reality for the greater healthcare system for maybe forever. Who knows? But certainly within society it won’t go away until herd immunity starts to get achieved.”


He suspects that immunity won’t be achieved until close to the end of 2021 or possibly even into 2022, once 80 to 90 per cent of the population are no longer able to catch the virus, as not everyone can even receive the vaccine yet.


Some people with severe allergies have experienced a reaction, though Thomas notes they were treated successfully. Testing has only begun on trials for children and pregnant women, and questions remain about how long the vaccine will remain effective in those who are inoculated.


“It’s just too soon to say how long immunity lasts. They know it’s really effective in the beginning,” said Thomas. “Maybe it will last your entire life, but maybe not.”


Thomas received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Friday, Jan. 8. Because this vaccine must be stored at ultra-low temperatures, that necessitated a trip into Corner Brook. In three weeks he will return for the second dose. Thomas says he has 100 percent confidence in the vaccine.


“We know Health Canada has a really high bar for efficacy and safety, and I’ve also looked at the data myself.”


Thomas was not the only medical professional from the area to be vaccinated. He also serves as Chief of Staff for LeGrow and shared that some of his staff also made the trip in on Friday.


As the pandemic began to sweep the globe, staff at LeGrow implemented new precautions to protect themselves and the patients they were caring for from COVID-19.


One of the first things they did was create a second emergency waiting room by using rooms in the outpatient department to treat patients for respiratory emergencies.


“We’ve taken extra steps to make sure that staff weren’t moving between units, particularly in the beginning,” said Thomas. “There was no cross between those seeing the sickest of patients and long-term care.”


That meant no doctors on the long-term care ward for roughly nine months. Instead a nurse practitioner served the ward and did not work in outpatient care.


Thomas did not step foot back into the long-term care ward until just before December, which he had last visited some time in March, even after the provincial government had eased protocols somewhat.


Others treating those with compromised immunity, such as cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, were not permitted to work in other departments either.


“We still choose to stay out of there if we can because we really don’t want to put anybody at risk in there,” he said. “If we’re seeing ER patients, we’re taking extra precautions to not enter wards where people would be more vulnerable.”


Thomas says that certain doctors were assigned to specific teams, and that the hospital is still focused on virtual care when possible.


“It is safer.”


Adjusting to the new normal has been hard on his staff at times. Changing in and out of full PPE (personal protective equipment) for 12 or more hours is not easy. Just having enough PPE available became “quite worrisome”.


“We never did run out, but there were times we were working quite low,” shares Thomas. “To change them out and do it properly, it does take a lot more time and effort. It slows you down greatly.”


Should a patient with COVID-19 present at the hospital, Thomas is confident the staff could ventilate and intubate them as needed. He notes that they would likely be transferred out soon, however, as they would require a full ICU package, which is not possible at LeGrow.

Thomas believes that although there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in this region, it has more than likely experienced one.


“I do suspect that there’s been probably cases that we’ve had here, and I certainly know that there’s been cases that have passed through town, but I do feel that we’ve probably had cases on the Southwest Coast. It just hasn’t been confirmed with testing,” admits Thomas.


He says he can’t prove it and may well be wrong, but notes that Stephenville and Corner Brook have had cases, and that Port aux Basques serves as a provincial gateway thanks to the Marine Atlantic ferry service.


“It’s based on probability. With the amount of people that we have returning to the area who work away, and who have travelled away, chances are we’ve had them, but through isolation and not affecting other people, we haven’t had a positive test here that I know of.”


Like many medical professionals, Thomas has made personal sacrifices in order to do his job, even living in an area that has remained largely unscathed.


“In the beginning I had a room set up in the basement, so away from my family. We’ve become more normal, but I know a lot of my colleagues did the same. They may have been in the same house, but they moved away from their family,” shares Thomas.


In fact, a couple of his colleagues from within the region moved their families out of province.


“They actually moved their kids to New Brunswick. They both knew they’d be heavily involved in the COVID unit and the ICU, so they moved their kids away.”


Now that things are under better control in Newfoundland and Labrador, most families have returned to a semblance of normality, but Thomas says medical professionals still take all the necessary precautions they need to in order to keep their families safe.


“It’s tough on everyone. I haven’t gone home. I haven’t seen my family (from) away since all this started. I’d love to see them. I’d love to have a more normal social life, and I’d love to not have to take all the precautions that we do right now.”


Thomas believes it will be summer or even fall before the region gets inoculated. The AstraZeneca vaccine, unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, does not require cold storage and can be administered much like the annual flu shot.


To date AstraZeneca has only been approved in the U.K., but Thomas believes it will be approved quite soon by Health Canada.",

  body: "Now that the holiday season is behind us, we are all preparing to start 2021 with resolutions. 


I am not a big fan of making New Year promises. I usually listen with some amusement at the variety of resolutions that my friends and family make. Most of the time, they are the ‘Big 3’ as I call them: Lose weight, stop smoking or get a better job. 


I won’t say that I’m immune to wanting to better myself, or improve my health. I’m currently trying to quit smoking, although this is not just a New Year’s Resolution. This is just common sense. 


I find that most resolutions seem to fall away within a month of making them. So last New Year, I made a different kind of resolution. Last year, my resolution was to learn a new skill.


Rather than try to lose my winter beer belly or get mad at myself for not being able to stop smoking again, I wanted to make a promise to myself to do something that I could be proud of. 


So when the town placed an ad for firefighters, I volunteered. I was lucky enough to be accepted, and now I am proud to serve my community as a volunteer firefighter. The training is hard, but very valuable. My fellow firefighters are friendly, welcoming and very knowledgable. 


That I was able to follow through on such a simple promise, and learn the skills necessary to do it, not only changed my life, but it gave me other benefits. I feel like I am in better shape, I feel more confident and I am generally in a more social mood. 


If resolutions are promises to be kept to yourself, then I highly recommend making a promise that you can be proud of. Don’t make the same ones you may have made in the past and were unable to complete.


I think that making the pledge to learn a new skill or a new talent is always a good plan. Learn to fish, learn a new instrument, learn to fix a clock, or even become a firefighter. 

This year my resolution is to learn a new skill again. I hate swimming, but maybe I’d like scuba diving. It would take a lot of practice, and I’d have to overcome my fear of deep water, but still, I might look into it. Maybe I’ll see you there.


Until then, Happy New Year!

  body: "Here’s what you need to know this week about the sports you love.


World Juniors Wind Down


The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) World Juniors are a long-standing holiday tradition for Canadians. But on the heels of a 2020 that left us all properly rotted some competitive hockey was sweet relief.


Team Canada made it to the final after a 5-0 drubbing of the young Russian Team. Following the semi-final, Coach Slava Fetisov said that not one Russian player was good enough for the Canadian squad. Good to see warm and fuzzy are alive and well in the land of vodka and nesting dolls.


But on Tuesday, Canada was handed their first loss along with a silver medal. An earlier loss or near miss might have left them readier to meet a stronger American team. 


Emotional Head Coach André Tourigny was proud of the kids that dominated amid the adversities of international competition during COVID.


Newfoundland and Labrador was well represented on Team Canada. 


Colorado Avalanche prospect Alex Newhook, playing injured, finished the tournament with 3 goals and 3 assists. Dawson Mercer, recently drafted by the New Jersey Devils, also impressed with 2 goals and 4 assists. Newhook is due to return to Boston College, and Mercer will be eligible to play in the AHL with the Q on hold.




NHL Noise


NHL teams took to the ice for an abbreviated training camp ahead of exactly zero pre-season games. That’s a recipe for a groin pull and sloppy hockey. Every Canadian team has made significant roster changes this off-season, and there will be limited opportunity to test lines and build chemistry.


Trial and error will count in the box score, but after a lengthy hiatus, fans and pundits are not complaining. Right now, we’d watch pond hockey with a goalie wearing his mother’s oven mitt for a blocker.


For Christmas, COVID gave us new divisions, including the Canadian Division… or is it the North Division? Oh wait… it’s the Scotia Division.


Canadian teams are going to be seeing a lot of each other and it begins on Wednesday night, Jan. 13, with the Habs in Toronto and the Oilers in Vancouver. Any chilled rivalries will have a kerosene fire lit under them, with teams facing each other 9 or 10 times throughout the shorter season.


The new divisions mean one lone Canadian team will make it to the 3rd round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. That will be the first game for a Canadian team against an American team in the 2020-21 season, and only one team from the north will get the opportunity.

Leafs fans can take comfort in the possibility that they can still be eliminated from the playoffs by the Boston Bruins.


NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman’s Christmas gift was a “Taxi Squad”. That means teams can waive players who don’t make their main roster, while keeping them around to practice with the team and be recalled quickly as needed.


They will have to pass through waivers, and still count on the team’s salary cap, but at an AHL-level hit. Teams that keep their farm teams close – Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa – could probably manage without this option.


For West coast teams with farm teams playing South of the border, the Taxi Squad is essential in the COVID format. The taxi squad opens a door for team General Managers to fix errors. A bad contract is unlikely to be claimed and can be kept close to the team while burying the cap in the cabbie, if you will. The player can play 10 games before having to pass through waivers again.


The Ottawa Senators are unlikely to go there on account of having an owner who gets hives when paying a player that doesn’t play. But teams nudging against the salary cap may get creative. Consider Loui Eriksson in Vancouver or Paul Byron in Montreal.


Fans are advised to not get their knickers in a knot every time a player is waived this season. We’ll see a lot of it as GMs manage a compressed schedule and a flat cap.




Raptors Racket


NHL coaches needing advice on how to adjust to a revamped roster could approach the Toronto Raptors for advice. Or not.


Following the departure of Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol, the Raptors have dug a hole for themselves to start the season. Coach Nick Nurse attributes the losing start to a lack of compete, but the eye test reveals a team that is disorganized in the D-zone, and missing the two big men they lost.


If the coach can’t get them in sync quickly, it may be up to Masai Ujiri to get some help or become a seller at the March 25th trade deadline.




Blue Jays Babble


The MLB season is scheduled to begin on April 1st, but all things are tentative while we deal with the second wave of a global pandemic. Whether they can successfully reel in free agent George Springer, or another high-impact player, President Mark Shapiro has committed to being active in free agency.


There will be new faces when the Jays take the field in the Spring. Along with the new, there will also be some improved faces. Fans following Vladimir Guerrero Jr. on Instagram have watched his offseason transformation as the young star has been getting his fit on.


In our dreams an agile 3rd baseman is snagging balls in Toronto, and a trip to see a live game is still part of the summer’s itinerary.

Stains and damage are clearly visible on its weathered white exterior, but the building will soon undergo some much needed repair work thanks to the province’s COVID-19 Stimulus Program. - © John Spencer",
  body: "SOUTHWEST COAST – Several communities and towns along the southwest coast received a late Christmas present this past week. Funding was approved for a variety of municipal enhancement projects around the province, including six municipalities around the Southwest Coast region.


The total amount of the monies being handed out by the province under the COVID-19 Stimulus Program (CSP) to municipalities along the Southwest Coast totals $519,323.56.

Towns that will receive funding include Burgeo, Burnt Islands, Channel-Port aux Basques, Isle aux Morts, Ramea, and Rose Blanche.


The CSP was designed for small or medium municipal enhancement, and COVID-19 refurbishment such as repair, maintenance or upgrades that are not usually covered under the existing Capital Works funding program.


Projects in each community that are approved are based on a 90/10 cost shared ratio, making these smaller projects more affordable for towns that have taken a financial hit thanks to the pandemic, which forced business closured and stymied the influx of summer tourism dollars. 


Under the program, the maximum amount available to a municipality was capped at $150,000. Mayor John Spencer of Channel-Port aux Basques is pleased with the announcement of funding. 


“It is a great announcement, to recondition an industrial building in the Grand Bay West area that has been an important part of our community infrastructure. This announcement will provide short term local employment in restoring the building. However, for the community at large, the $179,687.00 funding on a 90/10 provincial split is tremendous,” wrote Spencer via e-mail.


The building, sometimes referred to as the Brad Kennedy building, is near the Department of Highways depot and salt storage area. Spencer noted that the building exterior was “in tough shape”.


The Town of Isle aux Morts also has plans for its funding, which is earmarked for a couple of different facilities, including the fire hall and community centre. Isle aux Morts will receive $111,743.73 from the province to cover 90 percent of the repairs, which are expected to begin once winter is over and the weather becomes more favourable.


The Town of Rose Blanche-Harbour Le Cou has been approved for $27,469.65 to repair its salt shed, located adjacent to the town office. Work on that is also not expected to begin before the spring.


Burnt Islands has been approved for $57,130.59 to upgrade its water treatment system, while Burgeo will use its $ 132,568.97 to complete repairs on several municipal buildings. The province has also agreed to give Ramea $55,410.62 to repair its fire hall and heritage building.


MHA Andrew Parsons (Burgeo-La Poile) says there’s nothing but positives with this announcement.


“I was impressed two-fold,” said Parsons via phone interview on Tuesday, Jan. 6. “The province not only turned it around quickly, they processed it quickly.”


Parsons admits he was pleased to see towns, including those in his riding, move quickly to get in their applications.


“That’s not always easy,” noted Parsons. “That comes down to people in the communities realizing that this is a chance to get some work done that normally wouldn’t get done at 10 percent of the cost.”


The program launched on Nov. 23, 2020 and by Dec. 17 the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Municipalities announced that over 250 communities would benefit.


“Less than a month,” observed Parsons. “That’s pretty impressive on all fronts.”",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – If there’s one thing that people can count on besides death and taxes, it’s likely potholes.


As water freezes and thaws, it seeps into cracks in the asphalt and undermines it until vehicles passing over top cause it to collapse. With the milder temperatures this winter, the freeze-thaw cycle continues to take a toll on local roads.


“During the winter/spring season the Town asks residents to reduce their speed and drive with caution. The Town can not guarantee the condition of roads to be good at all times, and is continually making repairs whenever a pothole is reported,” said Town Manager Leon MacIsaac via e-mail.


Over the Christmas holidays, the Port aux Basques & Area Open Forum on Facebook lit up after one motorist lost a tire to a particularly large pothole on Main Street. Some responders even urged the motorist to sue for damages.


Usually damage to vehicles is covered by the owner’s insurance, but drivers do have the right to file suit against a municipality for damages. Doing that would likely be more expensive in the long run, and just proving the municipality liable can be difficult if not impossible.


“The claim would need to illustrate that the pothole was too big or deep, the driver had driven in a safe manner, made every attempt to avoid the pothole and the vehicle owner would have to prove that the municipality did not practice due diligence in addressing the repair,” stated MacIsaac.


MacIsaac’s letter noted that to date, the town has not received a written compensation claim because of a pothole, although the town office did receive a call from an individual who did not identify themself, asking if the town would replace a damaged tire.


“Staff did advise the individual that the Town does not typically provide compensation for tire damage,” wrote MacIsaac.


Municipalities are required to repair potholes within a specific time period from the date of its reporting, depending on certain conditions, clarified MacIsaac. Those can include weather conditions, availability of personnel, and materials required, and usually falls within a three-to-five day timespan.


“The size of what amounts to an unacceptably large pothole depends on the character of the street, its speed limit and average daily traffic. The type of road surface and the pothole’s location, on either the traveled portion of the road or the shoulder of the road, also determine how large a pothole has to be before it needs to be repaired and how long the municipality has to repair it,” MacIsaac stated.


Moreover, that clock only starts once a pothole is properly reported to the town. Once that happens, usually a temporary fix involving sandbags or a coldpatch will be put in until a stronger, more permanent repair can be done. If it’s the dead of winter, for example, that’s well outside of the traditional summer paving schedule, so the temporary fix may have to be replaced several times in the interim.


“The pothole has to be free of water and ice for a permanent repair, and even then, the permanent fix lifecycle is largely dependent on whether or not water infiltrates the repair again with the freeze-thaw cycle repeating itself.


“Town staff became aware of the pothole near Main Street Convenience after the heavy rainfall on Tuesday, Dec. 29, 2020. Staff placed sandbags in the pothole as a temporary fix and returned again on Wednesday, Dec. 30, 2020 to place coldpatch as a further temporary measure. Area potholes are monitored to determined whether further action is necessary.”


In fact, Public Works staff does keep a list of potholes within the municipality and a log of repairs made. On Monday, Jan. 4 staff were working to repair the tire-eating pothole on Main Street, but more rain was forecasted, which perpetuates the problem of potholes.",

  Editor’s note: MAiD, the acronym for Medical Assistance in Dying, became legal in Canada in 2016. A person with a grievous and irremediably medical condition where death is reasonably foreseeable can choose to seek medical assistance in dying. 


The story that follows is the journey of a family member choosing MAiD as his last wish – a wish to be at the helm in deciding how a life spanning nearly eight decades should end. 


It is our privilege to share with you Part 1 of this three-part journey of love and courage. Part 2 and Part 3 of the story will follow.





By JOHN SPENCER

Special to the Wreckhouse Weekly


It was a new phone with a two-year contract complete with a protective case.


 ”Bulletproof.”


Norm Osmond, describing a new phone with a two year contract complete with a protective case Those words flowed as easily as butter on a hot knife.


 Bulletproof. 


Another one to add to the list. 


I had come to know and appreciate Norm’s humour for over 50 years. Norm, who grew up in the ‘brook’ and I, by the fish plant on Pleasant Street, had married sisters from an area with its own unique reference, Lemmietown.


Norm always seemed to have one of those one liners tucked back there, a gift not unique to Norm. A gift for those spontaneous comments found around kitchen tables and fire pits. Those responses that crack you up.


Norm’s courage to dig one up given the circumstances at the time was so brave. The new cell phone was a healthy diversion from conversations that at times were strained for topics outside of Norm’s recent cancer diagnosis. The string of hospital visits, tests, nurses, and doctors – all filled with bad news. Ultrasounds, CT scans, biopsies.


They revealed two primary cancers – bladder and pancreatic.


Follow up bone scans indicated the cancer had already migrated. Other than palliative chemo treatment that, at best, offered a third of a chance of putting the cancers into remission, talk that evening of signing a two-year phone contract brought smiles into a bleak set of circumstances. Symbolically, it was a ray of hope. Perhaps, even a miracle was on the horizon.


Norm had become one of COVID-19’s collateral tragedies.


March madness, with medical care going into pandemic mode. The focus changed from the patient, to being asked to ‘be patient’. Norm fell into the ‘be patient’ group.


On the tip of his eight decades and nearly sixty years married. A life built on family, love, supporting each other, and endurance, he was always there for his two boys, always there for his grandchildren. And now, there for the newest member of the family, another generation. Norm stood proud for a great grandchild.


Norm had toe tapped in Christmas, with eagerly anticipated and much-loved skidoo trips planned in February and March. There were always things to be done in the camp on Grand Bay Brook. Winter provided the opportunity for quick access. Norm proudly took to his skidoo in early March.


COVID-19 took centre stage. Primary health care got put on the back burner. Talk of hygiene, distancing, and isolation. Talk of bubbles. Lost in this shuffle were individuals. Those waiting had to wait some more.


Norm was one of many that was lost.


Feeling a lot worse in April, but not one to complain, Norm in isolation was doing his best to stay patient. There was a loss of appetite, coinciding with rapid weight loss. Norm was slowing down.


He was deadly ill by May, and diagnostics became urgent. By June, Norm’s cancer was stage four. Norm was now in a dark place with little hope.


Talk of a new cell that evening brought smiles on what was to be a short journey.

  body: "MILLVILLE – Living off the grid is a lifestyle choice that isn’t for everyone, but for Megan Samms and Ashley Hall, it’s one that suits them perfectly. The couple met just over 10 years ago on Vancouver island. They’ve lived and worked in wildfire lookouts for over a decade.


“They’re off grid too. They’re all remote,” says Samms. “I read about them when I was 18 or 19, I think in a Jack Kerouac book. I didn’t think they existed in Canada.”


When she was around 19, Samms moved out west and a chance meeting with one of her massage therapy clients led to a career change. Hall had become a wildfire lookout thanks to an ex-girlfriend’s father.


“The tech that they’re developing just can’t seem to tell the difference between pollen plumes and smoke and fog wisps,” says Samms. “They’re reporting all of it and it turns out to still be more expensive to send a helicopter to look at it than it is to pay a person to sit and know what they’re looking at.”


Living in a remote tower staring at the scenery through binoculars all day seems to be right up their alley. After 13 and 11 years, respectively, spent as lookouts the pair decided it was time for a change.


“We did separate fire lookouts, and so that’s like 13 years is six and a half years by yourself just for all summer. There’s some pretty incredible experiences to be had out there, but then there’s also a lot of sacrifice.”


During her tenure as a lookout, Samms kept bees, chickens and a huge garden. She’s also a weaver and even operated her business from her tower.


“I did all my dye work and wove all my cloth,” she says. “We just reached a point where we wanted to do all of those big projects at home, at our own place.”


Samms hails originally from the Codroy Valley area, and in May 2020 she and Hall relocated to the area permanently. The couple even chose to build their new eco-friendly home practically across the street from where she grew up.


The couple still keep bees, heritage chickens and a garden. Samms continues to dye and weave her own cloth. The couple offer a small apothecary line featuring herbal remedies and body care, sourced from the flowers and plants on their property or from their garden and using fresh spring or sea water.


“It’s basically the exact same thing we did in the summer, except without the fire lookout part,” notes Hall.


Her online textile shop featuring her line of woven towels, blankets and sometimes even clothing is called Live Textiles (livetextiles.online). 


People do buy directly from the couple, but to date they have also organized two markets to feature their products.


“We’re planning to have them quarterly, so a spring, summer, autumn and winter market every year. So that’s kind of a major selling point for everything that we make,” says Samms.


The timing of the markets means different products are offered at each market, as the ingredients available to be sourced change with the weather. In the summer, they can offer teas and and freshly cut flowers and herbs. By winter the herbs are dried and there are woven juniper wreaths along with some textiles.


These markets have allowed other area crafters and artists an opportunity to feature their products. They also use the opportunity to support local non-profits, usually through a door prize draw fundraiser.


“I think we had eight or ten vendors at each market,” offers Samms.


The first market was held outside, across the street from E. W. (Hockey) Gale’s store in September. There was live music and a pop-up coffee shop.


“It was astounding how many people came out,” says Hall.


The second was held inside at the Wetlands Centre in mid-December. Not as many attended thanks to some foul weather, but there was a steady flow of buyers anyway.


“We’re going to keep doing them. They’re super fun, because of the live music and the pop-up coffee shop, they end up being more of a community event,” promises Samms.


The couple hope to move the market to different locations around the valley and even possibly down the coast towards the Port aux Basques area.


“We really see with the markets that there’s a lot of people making stuff or growing stuff in the Valley, and really all that’s needed is an organized venue to sell that stuff,” says Hall. “There’s also an interest in purchasing stuff locally.”


The couple’s efforts has received local support. Samms has a mentor, a former beekeeping partner, who taught her how to breed honeybees.


“He’s been keeping bees organically for over 50 years,” she says. “We bred our bees off of honeybees from the Valley.”


Next year they’re hoping to breed from elsewhere in the province to bring in different genetics. They also keep a variety of heritage chickens.


“Probably next year we’ll think about raising a couple of pigs as well,” says Samms.


The two still have bigger plans for their new home beyond livestock. They are hoping to build a summer kitchen and a studio for the textile business that will also double as an artist’s retreat.


Cooking on a woodstove in the summer is actually hotter than the two find comfortable, and Samms could use more space for her textile business. They are also eager to support fellow artists, so offering a natural retreat is in keeping with their lifestyle.


And a natural retreat is exactly what they will offer. Everything they build and do is completely off grid.


Samms’ father did some excavation and neighbours donated and helped install some old windows in the home they designed and built.


The house is about 20 x 24 with a 20 x 16 loft sleeping area and 18 ft. ceilings. This is no rough wood log cabin but a toasty, inviting retreat with a custom designed pantry and polished kitchen that looks like something showcased in an architectural magazine.

It took them most of the summer to build it. They moved in sometime around the end of October.


“Our house is currently running on a 1240-watt, 4-panel solar system that’s stored in 4 deep cycle batteries and gives us the option of running things on 24 volt or plug-in power,” says Hall.


During a recent power outage, the couple remained unaware until they tried to listen to the radio and couldn’t tune in to the station.


“We were just gloating,” laughs Hall.


“Being off grid, it’s a bigger thing than just not being tied in,” says Samms. “We use a wood cookstove, so we don’t have an electric or propane stove or heating, so our wood cookstove heats the house and we cook on it every meal.”


They also don’t have a washing machine, a dishwasher, or even running water in their custom designed house. Things are done the old way, by hand, but with a modern twist.

For example, the couple uses large water bags they haul around in wagons to keep water in the house so they don’t have to dash out in the freezing cold in the mornings.


Water heats quickly on their wood cookstove, and Samms says it doesn’t take long to even fill a large galvanized tub for bathing. If that sounds like too much work for some, it doesn’t appear to be for Samms and Hall.


“Going off grid means you take a hard look at what your power consumption might be, and you cut out some of the excesses, which turns out to not really be a sacrifice,” says Hall.


The two made a deliberate choice not to install modern appliances in their solar powered home.


“You can expand your solar setup to include all of those amenities, but we didn’t want to,” notes Samms. “The larger the system, the more maintenance it will require eventually, and it’s still a lot of power consumption.”


“Heating water is one of the greatest consumers of power,” notes Hall, who installed their home’s solar system. “There’s certain things that just become too cost prohibitive with a solar system.”


Back when they were working in the towers, heating water to bathe or showering outside using a rain bag was just another part of the routine.


Although the farm is not certified organic, their practices are certainly keeping in line with long-term sustainability, which Samms says is very important to them both. That means being environmentally responsible, right down to not tossing a washer in a landfill when it no longer works.


“You have to reassess a lot of aspects of how you live your life with convenience – convenience being power,” says Hall. “Letting go of all of those things opens up a huge realm of opportunity for creative thinking and just how to do things differently because you’ve completely thrown the rule book out the window.”

Welcome back! Before I begin, I would like to wish everyone a Happy New Year and wish all the best to everyone in 2021! Now that we are finished the Christmas season for another year, I know everyone probably has their fridges and freezers filled with desserts and cookies, so I figured for this month I would keep it short and sweet with a classic favourite. This recipe is quite versatile – you can use mandarin oranges, raisins, coconut or anything else you’d like to experiment with. You could even reduce the sugar and add shredded cheese to make a nice cheese biscuit with your dinner. This month we are making Classic Tea Biscuits (Biscotti da tè classici).


Ingredients:

1 cup of butter

1 cup of sugar

4 eggs

5 cups of flour

2 tbsp or baking powder

1 tsp of salt

1 cup of milk


Optional:

Raisins

Mandarin oranges

Coconut

Cheddar Cheese


Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 370º.

2. Sift together dry ingredients.

3. Combine eggs and milk, set aside.

4. Mix butter and sugar until light and fluffy (if making a savoury biscuit, reduce sugar

to ½ cup) .

5. Slowly add butter mixture to dry ingredients and mix until combined

6. Make a well and add egg/milk mixture and mix.

7. Fold in flavouring ingredient of your own choice. 

 8. On a floured surface work dough and cut out with a bun cutter (or a drinking glass is a great substitute), place on parchment paper and bake for approx. 20 to 25 minutes.

9. Cool on cooling racks and enjoy.",

  subtitles: "Habs fan Rob Matic, who had invested in a Corey Perry reverse retro jersey, was watching the waiver wire a little more closely than most! - @ Rob Matic",
  body: "Here’s what you need to know this week about the sports you love.




NHL Noise

The deadline for NHL teams to submit their 23-man rosters was Tuesday, Jan. 12 at 5 p.m. In the days leading up to it, hard core fans were obsessing on how their teams would become compliant with NHL requirements. 


Would kids on entry level contracts be demoted? Would teams get creative with undesirable contracts? Would taxi squad veterans be left unmolested by rival general managers? Who would be most innovative in finalizing their crews? 


As they say, there’s more than one way to pluck a turr.  


Montreal Canadiens fans were focused on Corey Perry. While past his prime, hard-core fans were still excited to see the caustic veteran in a Habs jersey. Having heard GM Marc Bergevin pontificate on Perry’s importance to the team, fans were confused when he was waived. But 24 hours later, Perry was still a Hab. 


In the innovation category, Winnipeg Jets GM Kevin Cheveldayoff waived Matthieu Perreault, a veteran whose production no longer matched his pocketbook. Chevy chose to maximize the cap savings on a player unlikely to be claimed. They don’t call him Clever Clogs for nothing.


The puck finally dropped on Wednesday, Jan. 13. The first face off the 2020-21 season was in Philadelphia where the Pittsburgh Penguins were in town to meet the Flyers. Does anyone give a fiddler’s flying flip who won that one? I figured. 


In the Scotia division, the remodeled Habs were in Toronto to face the Maple Leafs who had their own share of new additions. Of course, if hockey players can be compared to vehicles, the Leafs additions are more “used” than new. 


What a show these two put on for opening night! Montreal took a 3-1 lead on two goals from new addition Josh Anderson but were unable to hold on. Morgan Reilly was the overtime hero for the Leafs. Who is in for nine more matchups?  


To quote Twitter’s @MimiLeMeow, “…it’s good to see two Canadian NHL teams looking good for a change. It’s about time, wankers.”


In Edmonton, the Vancouver Canucks surprised the Oilers with a 5-3 win. Brock Boeser was the hero in this one with two goals including the game winner. Every game on opening night was a high scoring affair as teams struggled to find their defensive games without the benefit of a pre-season.




Curling Clamour

Fans who like their rink sports with a little less spit and truculence have all eyes on the goings-on in the curling world. After some pandemic adjustments, the Scotties Tournament of Hearts is set to begin on Feb. 20, while the Tim Horton’s Brier is penciled in for Mar. 6.

Playdowns are scheduled for the end of the month to determine who will represent Newfoundland and Labrador at each bonspiel. Hurry! Hard!




Raptors Racket

As of press deadline, the Toronto Raptors were 2-8 through 10 games to start the season. That record has them in the NBA basement with the Detroit Pistons. Regardless, there have been signs of life. 


Pascal Siakam is looking more like the player fans and pundits expected, and Chris Boucher is finding his way. They’ve had a couple of close games, particularly against Portland, where they just couldn’t get the bounces. 


In short, the Raptors have graduated from flat out losses to moral victories. Nothing makes merchandise fly off the shelves like losing the right way.




Blue Jays Babble

On Wednesday, Rogers Communications announced a five-year extension for President and CEO Mark Shapiro. Shapiro replaced Paul Beeston in 2015. 


Fans will recall that Alex Anthopoulos, the beloved GM that took the Jays to the American League Championship Series in 2015, declined a contract extension following Shapiro’s hire. Ross Atkins was hired to replace Anthopoulos in the GM role.


Shapiro and Atkins were left with a hard act to follow. After a rough beginning and what some might call a “reset”, the Jays are expected to field a young and dynamic team in 2021. Young players like Bo Bichette and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. are the hopefuls to bring Canadian fans some playoff baseball.


A final note from the diamond – Tommy Lasorda passed away on Jan. 7th. Lasorda had a brief pitching career but is best known as manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers from 1976 to 1996. 


A prolific manager, a Hall of Famer (1997), and an Olympic Gold Medalist (2000 Summer Olympics), Lasorda is probably best known for his colorful quotes and sayings. I’ll leave you with one.


“About the only problem with success is that it does not teach you how to deal with failure.” ~ Tommy Lasorda (1927-2021).

  subtitles: "Tracey Lee Hunt of Stephenville (left) enjoyed a pleasant staycation tour of Grand Bruit courtesy of Mandy Ryan Francis, owner and operator of Port aux Basques Marine Excursions, which offers resettlement and fishing tours. Like most tourism operators in the province, Francis has taken a significant financial hit thanks to the global pandemic. - courtesy of PAB Marine Excursions",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – On Friday, Jan. 8, the province announced a small extension for its Tourism Hospitality Support Program. The program is designed to help offset the financial impact of COVID-19, which has been felt throughout the province, and by operators along the Southwest Coast.


The deadline has been pushed back to Friday, Jan. 29, and successful applicants can receive a one-time, non-repayable contribution of either $5,000 or $10,000, dependent on gross sales. Operators with less than $10,000 in sales reported in 2019 can still receive funding of up to 50 percent of gross sales or 50 percent of initial startup costs.


As COVID-19 continues to hamstring the Newfoundland and Labrador tourism industry and threatens to derail this year’s summer season, the government hopes that operators can use this funding to hang on until the pandemic abates and tourism starts to recover.


“Operators involved in the provincial tourism and hospitality sector contribute in many ways to our economy. The Tourism and Hospitality Support Program provides eligible operators with access to support to assist with the financial impacts being faced as a result of the pandemic,” wrote MHA Andrew Parsons, Minister of Industry, Energy and Technology in the news release.


Mandy Ryan Francis of Port aux Basques Marine Excursions says that the hit to her outfitting business is worse than what she had initially feared, and even enrolling in the province’s Staycation NL campaign and social media marketing was not enough to make up the difference.


“About 90-95 percent of the guests we hosted this past season originated from this province. There just weren’t enough of them to make up for what we would normally get from Central Canada and the U.S.,” stated Francis via e-mail.


Port aux Basques Marine Excursions also refunded all bookings for guests who live outside the Atlantic bubble. As the province kept rolling out new programs, Francis kept abreast of possible relief funding by contacting the local tourism office. Under the Tourism Hospitality Support Program, PAB Marine Excursions was able to receive funding to help take care of fixed business costs.


“It was a relatively straightforward application process,” says Francis.


In fact, it only took Francis five days from the time she submitted the application to receiving approval. To date, the program has approved over 1,096 applications, and Parsons, who also serves as MHA Burgeo-La Poile, hopes that more tourism operators along the Southwest Coast will send in an application.


“We’re trying to help these really cool ventures,” said Parsons via phone interview on Wednesday, Jan. 6.


Part of that help involves trying to find new ways to market tourism businesses during a global pandemic.


“There’s so many challenges that they’re facing – be it the Atlantic bubble, COVID restrictions, and so on,” noted Parsons. “That doesn’t mean you just let your business die. You’ve got to figure out a way. How do you get around that?”


The lack of tourism has a larger rippling affect. Airlines are cutting back too, meaning airports and their stores and suppliers are struggling.


On Wednesday, Jan. 13, Air Canada cut all routes to Labrador, and suspended routes between Gander and Halifax, Goose Bay and Halifax, and St. John’s and Toronto beginning Saturday, Jan. 23. The carrier, which has received significant federal funding, cited “stifled demand” thanks to provincial travel and quarantine restrictions.


Those restrictions aren’t likely to ease anytime soon either. Health Minister John Haggie has stated that even with vaccinations starting to roll out, the current provincial guidelines may remain in effect into 2022. For smaller operators who cannot offset revenues by targeting staycationers or Atlantic bubble tourism, that length of time can mean a death blow.


“We, as a province, have done extremely well with our (COVID-19 infection) numbers, but what’s the price for that?,” asked Parsons rhetorically. “Obviously I’m very supportive of anybody in my district, and now that I’m running this department I’m learning more about it. I think it’s a golden opportunity.”


Parsons encourages any small business entrepreneur or tourism operator to contact Bruce Billard, who is the region’s Economic Development Officer.


“It’s not about giving money away to businesses. It’s about government trying to make investments,” said Parsons. “There are ways forward.”


On Friday, Jan. 15, Premier Andrew Furey’s office announced a new advisory council had been formed to help develop short-term and long term initiatives to support the battered tourism industry.


“We are an industry that reflects our culture, our arts and our history – a true reflection of who we are as Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. This has been a devastating time for the tourism industry, we have had unprecedented challenges and uncertainty at every step this past year. But this is an industry built upon ingenuity and I see this council as an opportunity to harness our collective energies as we navigate our way through the effects of COVID-19 on our industry and to economic recovery. We are a group of people who have built businesses from pure innovation here in Newfoundland and Labrador. This innovation is now called upon as we gather as a council to look at not only the immediate needs for our industry, but the opportunities for the future. Tourism has the ability to be a game changer in our economy. Our growth and success is built upon showing the world who we are,” wrote Jill Curran, Chair, Premier’s Advisory Council on Tourism.",

  body: "NASHVILLE, TN – Even though she has left the island of Newfoundland for the honky-tonks of Nashville, Tennessee, Mallory Johnson still comes back home to the Codroy Valley every year. The versatile musician, singer, songwriter, and actress was pretty much stranded here for a while last year. 


“I was home from March of 2020, until the end of October,” said Johnson via telephone interview on Friday, Jan. 16. 


“I was originally supposed to go on tour, to do the Reklaws Arts and Culture Center run, followed by a coast to coast radio tour. So I flew home, and a day or two later, everything was being postponed or cancelled. The Reklaws is still in the books. I’m not sure when exactly that’s happening.”


Johnson doesn’t see her unanticipated Newfoundland staycation as a bad thing. Instead, she calls it a blessing in disguise, since it allowed her new opportunities in the way of spontaneous collaborations, and a chance to write new music with friends and family.


“It was so nice, and so much fun to just get creative with friends.”


Johnson has a solid family pedigree when it comes to music. The Cormiers are still beloved on the entire east coast of Canada, having toured Scotland and North America.  She was already fairly accomplished by the time she was on tour with her mother, Loretta, her Uncle Gordon, and her cousin, Randall. 


She sang the national anthems at the Air Canada Center, as well as at the Maple Leaf Gardens at the age of 8, making her the youngest to do so. She wrote her first song at the age of 11. 


Now back in Nashville, Johnson has a busy schedule despite the limitations of a global pandemic that has hit the USA hard.


“Next week I’m going to be going back into the studio, and I’ll be recording a new album.”


This will be Mallory Johnson’s first full-length solo album, having previously released an EP of six songs. The new album is being produced by Kent Wells, who has also produced for Dolly Parton. She pauses when asked about a possible release date, since work is just beginning, but hopes it doesn’t get held back too long.


Johnson has been surrounded by big names since she moved down to Nashville, starting with manager Sammy Kershaw. 


After winning a Newfoundland-wide singing competition, a judge reached out to Kershaw in 2015. Kershaw checked out some of Johnson’s Youtube videos and immediately advised her to move to Nashville, and that he wanted to manage her. 


“This was my Cinderella ‘pinch me’ moment. I mean, I just played three songs at a local pub, and now I’m in the Grand Ole Opry with my mom, watching Rascal Flatts, and Sammy Kershaw calls me to tell me to go to bed early because I’m singing in the morning!” She laughs at the memory, calling it “wild” and a “whole new experience”. 


Johnson is still getting her fair share of new experiences.


“One of the gals on my management team, Cathy Nakos, said, ‘Do you want to audition for a movie’, and I said, ‘Well why not?’”


Despite not attempting to do the Southern accent that was required for the reading, Johnson brought her guitar to the audition, and was asked to do a little singing.

It was just a day or two later that she was told they were writing a part for her in the film, as long as she sang.


“I went to Knoxville for two days, did some filming, and wrote a couple of songs for them, so I’m glad I wasn’t left on the cutting room floor!”


“Into the Wilderness”, directed by Richard De Witt, has not yet been released.


Johnson’s career has continued to climb steadily, from playing music with her family, all the way to making a movie.  She cites Celtic music as a favourite inspiration, and says it’s not difficult to hear the similarities between the Honky-Tonks of Tennessee and the folk bands of Newfoundland. 


“The genres of both compliment each other so well, because the root of both of them is storytelling. They use a lot of the same instrumentation.”


Johnson says she has reached heights she never thought possible. 


“This was always my dream. You definitely always have those faraway goals that you hope you reach. Ever since coming to Nashville and having that whole experience, I never really write anything off. Any dream I put on my vision board, now I think, thats not too big of a dream.”


Johnson’s current goals are to play the Grand Ole Opry and, “Obviously a record deal would be nice, a publishing deal, all those things.”


She still enjoys her Newfoundland roots. Johnson plans to take part in a Cormier reunion live on Zoom on Wednesday, Jan. 20. 


“I’m interested to see how its going to go. I’m excited!”",

  body: "Editor’s note: MAiD, the acronym for Medical Assistance in Dying, became legal in Canada in 2016. A person with a grievous and irremediably medical condition where death is reasonably foreseeable can choose to seek medical assistance in dying. 

The story that follows details the journey of Norman Osmond, who chose MAiD as his last wish – a wish to be at the helm in deciding how his life, spanning nearly eight decades should end. 




Despite the dark road ahead, Norm’s time in hospital was limited to just two occasions. The first was a three-day stay at the regional facility in Corner Brook. The second was a week at the local hospital in Port aux Basques.


Norm had been diagnosed with two primary cancers. There was evidence that one of the cancers had now spread into his bones. Both stays in hospital had given a Norm a ray of hope. Both raised expectations. However, neither was able to go beyond palliative care.

The battle to stabilize the deadly invasion had been an excruciating experience. Both visits challenged the remarkable professionalism of Norm’s caregivers – the doctors, nurses, and support personnel.


Norm was very appreciative of the level of care. However, the hospital stays took their toll. Energies now focused on another important date. Norm was on the eve of his 79th birthday. Friday, July 24. That day became a goal.


Norm’s family doctor, nurses and medical support teams spent hours getting him home for his birthday. It would be Norm’s last stay in hospital. Norm’s comments as he was about to leave, besides always thankful, were the offer of a ‘bottle’ for the doctor, and to a nurse, the opportunity to dance the next time they met. He was going home.


On the eve of Norm’s second release from hospital his corner grew darker.


The medical decision had been put forth for him to consider discontinuing palliative chemotherapy as a life extending option. This decision was not easy, but was based on Norm’s severe reaction to the first round of chemo.


A second round had been cancelled, and there was little hope of Norm having the strength to endure a third. After rapid weight loss, and with one organ already shut down, Norm was not strong enough to go on. Norm’s care was now geared towards pain therapy on an end of life program.


News of this new path did not sit well with Norm. Norm had spoken of asking for a needle.

The idea of the doctor being able to relieve his anguish through a needle became a common topic of conversation. Norm was adamant. The week in hospital had taken its toll. There were doubts. What was in store? Where was Norm heading?


A path from independence to dependence, then perhaps uncertainty, while looking to others to administer drugs to keep him comfortable was not sitting well. There had be another alternative.


An email reaching out to the medical world was not easy to write. Norm’s request for MAiD, medical assistance in dying, was submitted.


He knew his death was imminent. He did not wish to return to a hospital. He wanted to be at the helm.


There was a sense of urgency, a need to put a new path in motion while still being able to give consent. A window of waiting another ten days was closing. Having drugs administered in the form of pain therapy through a butterfly implant would gradually take away his ability to give consent.


Things moved quickly though.


The application process, medical interviews and approvals were in place within days.

Norm had a resurgence of newfound energy. There was even talk of a drive. On a quiet Sunday morning in August, Norm took the wheel for one last drive around to see his beloved town. 


There were a lot of new things to see. The new municipal garage in Grand Bay brought forward the comment, “That must have cost a few thousand”, followed up with an editorial from me, his co-pilot, the mayor, “We wish it was only a few.”


We both had a laugh. It was a good day.


Norm was true to form in the interviews with the medical teams assessing his readiness for MAiD. When asked what it meant, Norm simply replied “Death.”


When asked again in another way, Norm, as a testament of his understanding and courage, responded, “No more ice cream.” 


Another interview. Another doctor. Another question.


Norm was asked whether the procedure should continue knowing he was in control and could stop it at any point. What would he say?


Norm responded, “Green light all the way.”


He was ready.


This story concludes next week in Part 3: Norm in Control, available Monday, January 25.

  subtitles: "A review into allegations that former Justice Minister and current Attorney General Andrew Parsons (MHA Burgeo - La Poile) will be conducted by RCMP Nova Scotia, as requested by RCMP NL. Parsons has dismissed allegations that he politically interfered with the Joe Smyth case as “ridiculous”.",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Nova Scotia RCMP are investigating MHA Andrew Parsons (Burgeo-La Poile), the current Attorney General for Newfoundland and Labrador and Minister of Industry, Energy and Technology. Prior to being moved to the Energy portfolio by Premier Andrew Furey shortly after he assumed office, Parsons was the Minister of Justice.


The investigation is looking into allegations of political interference in the criminal case of Joe Smyth, a former RNC officer who was charged with obstruction of justice over his handling of a traffic stop in 2017. Smyth was initially convicted in 2019, but that conviction was later overturned.


Parsons is alleged to have played a part in bringing about the original charges against Smyth.


The matter received provincial attention after a document on the VOCM website revealed a screenshot of a text message, supposedly between former Minister Sherry Gambin Walsh and Acting RNC Inspector Paul Didham, along with an opinion letter (“Smyth should never have been charged” published by The Telegram on Nov. 15, 2020).


In the leaked complaint, Smyth wrote, “I am advised that other persons close to Andrew Parsons have witnessed him express a personal animus towards me. I am advised that Andrew Parsons expressed anger at having to cover legal costs associated with the criminal charges laid against me and during a public inquiry. I am advised that Andrew Parsons was angered when presented with a Journey Authorization in 2017 for my Marine Unit Assignment in Labrador assisting the RCMP with an operation in Cartwright, NL, and that he destroyed the original JA that had to be quickly resent.”


Only hours later, RNC Chief Joe Boland and the province’s Director of Public Prosecutions, Lloyd Strickland, refuted the claims.


In a release, Strickland wrote, “Any allegation of political interference with the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is a serious accusation and an affront to the integrity of Public Prosecutions and the Crown attorneys that dutifully serve the public.”


Parsons called the allegations “ridiculous” and “beyond belief”.


Last Monday, Jan. 11, RCMP NL issued a statement advising that RCMP Nova Scotia will be reviewing the complaint “to determine investigative steps”. The review by RCMP Nova Scotia comes at the request of RCMP NL to keep the investigation independent and transparent.


“The leadership of the investigation and all investigative decisions rest with RCMP Nova Scotia. Police officers from RCMP NL may be tasked to support the investigation, as needed.”


According to the statement, no further comment will be forthcoming from either detachment while the investigation is underway. News that the RCMP Nova Scotia will look into the allegations didn’t seem to surprise Parsons, who spoke by phone later that evening.


“I’ve said all along that whenever there’s a situation like this that people have to see things are being done properly. What’s worse than a wrongful accusation is one that people say was not dealt with properly or appropriately. So I’ve got absolutely no issue with that, but I stick to what was said all along. This is an absolute political hack smear job orchestrated by (PC Opposition Leader) Ches Crosbie and others.”


Parsons says he is “absolutely confident” in his track record and decisions, and welcomes the investigation.


“I know what I know, and you want the public to be reassured of that, but there’s no doubt that there’s a sense of frustration,” said Parsons. “Even the fact that it’s reported leads people to believe that there’s truth to it.”


After the RCMP NL statement, the provincial Tories began calling on Premier Andrew Furey to remove Parsons from cabinet while the investigation is underway. Justice Critic Helen Conway Ottenheimer has stated that allowing Parsons to remain in cabinet smacks of a double standard, noting that Walsh had to step aside when she was being investigated by the RCMP, and that MHAs Eddie Joyce and Dale Kirby were removed during parliamentary investigations.


But a statement released by Furey’s office has made it clear that the Premier has no intention of asking Parsons to step aside.


“Nova Scotia RCMP is reviewing the complaint as is standard procedure to ensure an independent and transparent process. The Chief of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary and the Director of Public Prosecutions have both already publicly confirmed there was no interference. Accordingly, this does not impede the Minister’s ability to serve and there will be no changes to cabinet.”",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The first town council meeting of the year got underway at 6 p.m. on Wednesday evening, Jan. 13. Before delving into council matters, Mayor John Spencer, councilors and attendees observed a moment of silence in honour of former Mayor Aneitha Sheaves, who passed away on Friday, Jan. 8.


Two taxi companies, two letters

Both owners of the two taxi serves operating in Port aux Basques sent letters to council.

The first outlined the difficulties he’s faced in 2020, in part because of the pandemic. The owner wrote that a reduced demand for the service prompted the removal of four cars from his fleet. “My employees and I would like the town to reconsider the expansion of another taxi business in our community,” concluded the letter.

The second letter by the newly established taxi service requested permission to add on a second car to its fleet. The request was approved.

“There’s no way we can stop new businesses from starting. That’s not what we’re here for,” noted Coun. Chester Coffin. The sentiment was echoed by several other members of council.


Roadwork

Councilors don’t enjoy dodging potholes anymore than any other motorist.

Deputy Mayor Todd Strickland stated that upon leaving work one evening he narrowly skirted a deep pothole that lacked reflective signage or lights to warn motorists or clarify the flow of traffic. On another occasion he observed a tractor trailer swerve at the last minute to avoid it, and considers it fortunate that no accident occurred. Town workers are currently focused on patching up the worst spots.

Members of Public Works are also going to take a look at some of the narrower sections of Main Street where vehicles are having trouble passing. One solution may be the removal of a couple of parking spots.

“Across from Bar & Billiards, people have lost mirrors there,” observed Coun. Jim Lane.


Downtown municipal depot

Council has not yet decided what to do with the downtown municipal depot. One suggestion is to re-purpose materials from the building to help build a new smokehouse for the town’s fire department.

“The building should be demolished in a proper way, not haphazardly,” noted Town Manager Leon MacIsaac. 


Outdoor skating rink

Mayor Spencer showed hesitancy to support the idea of outdoor skating rink, noting that at the Bruce II use of the rink is tightly controlled. The weather has not permitted its construction anyway, but as the outdoor rink is monitored by volunteers who can’t be there all the time, he is worried about social distancing, especially when children are present.

Coun. Justin Blackler was of a different opinion.

“I don’t see an outdoor rink as any increase,” said Blackler, noting that he oversees 300 students and is active in youth hockey.

Council is aware that some residents and children not active in hockey or who don’t use the rink at the Bruce II regularly take advantage of the rink. Despite that, the consensus is not to have the rink this year, assuming the weather ever decides to co-operate.


Railway support

Mayor Spencer asked councilors to support efforts to have the railway reinstated in Cape Breton. He noted that there is no dominant Eastern seaport, but Sydney could fill that role for offloading freight. The port has received significant upgrades but is really only receiving cruise ships. Were it to become a predominant entry point into the country, it would create more jobs and drive economic growth.

Newfoundland and Labrador would indirectly benefit by the reduced wait times for freight.

“What’s happening is that there’s a power base that goes up through the St. Lawrence that’s blocking any development on the Eastern seaboard,” said Spencer. “If you look out here tonight, beautiful big container vessels out here waiting to go up through the Gulf of St. Lawrence. That same freight could come ashore in Sydney.”

Council voted to allow Spencer to sign on behalf of the town.",

  subtitles: "A garbage truck collects in the East End Channel area of Port aux Basques on Friday, Jan. 15. Residential dwellings with less than three units will not see a fee increase, but apartment buildings and some businesses will have to pay more starting in April. - J. René Roy / Wreckhouse Press",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The Marine and Mountain Zone Waste Management Committee (MMZ), under Western Regional Waste Management (WRWM) has determined that it is necessary to increase garbage fees for commercial, government, institutional and multi-residential property owners in 2021. Residential fees and smaller businesses will stay the same.


Coun. Melvin Keeping reported on the decision during a Town Council meeting on Wednesday, Jan. 18, noting that local service districts and other communities within the region had been informed the previous evening.


“This was supposed to have been implemented last year,” noted Keeping. “The decision was made that we would leave it as is until COVID was over but now that it’s a year later, basically, we’re starting to implement these fees.”


Keeping explained that the increases were necessary because of the discrepancy in volumes between a single unit dwelling and a multi-unit apartment building, which are currently paying the same rate of $160 per year.


“A person who’s got an apartment building with 10 units, all last year, paid the same as what I was paying,” cited Keeping as an example.


Before deciding to increase the fees, the committee reviewed waste tonnage collected, associated tipping fees, and operational costs such as equipment and maintenance.

Keeping said that maintaining the aging garbage truck has been one of the larger costs associated with collection in this region. He noted that the poor road conditions throughout the region, including Codroy Valley, don’t help either.


Town Manager Leon MacIsaac noted that the town spent in excess of $140,000 to keep the truck in service last year.


“Under the current fee structure that’s not sustainable,” noted MacIsaac.


Port aux Basques did get one new truck last year and a second is scheduled to be delivered this November, and Keeping hopes that will help significantly reduce maintenance costs.


“When you’re transporting garbage all over creation, to Norris Arm, it’s going to cost you money and it’s a money pit. It’s not going to end,” said Mayor John Spencer. “We’ve got to find a waste disposal site on the West coast.”


The 2021 fee structure rolls out on April 1 as follows:


Residential fees (less than three units) will remain the same at $160 per year. Owners of residential properties containing three or more dwelling units, such as apartment buildings, will be obliged to pay $160 annually per unit.


Small, independent, locally owned and operated businesses that produce less than 10 bags of garbage per week will not have their collection fees of $160 per year increased.

Businesses that produce between 10 and 15 bags of garbage per week will double to $320 annually. Mid-sized businesses that produce 15 to 30 bags every week will triple to $480 per year.


Mid-size to larger businesses, designated as Class 4 Commercial, that produce 30 to 60 bags per week will be obliged to pay $53.32 per month, which works out to $640 annually, which is four times the current rate.


Private RV parks or campgrounds that produce in excess of 100 bags of waste per week will have to pay a collection fee of $2,500 per year. This fee will be reviewed by MMZ on an annual basis to determine if any further adjustment is needed.


Government and educational buildings will increase to $1,000 annually. Institutional properties such a senior homes and care facilities will pay $7,500 per year. MMZ will also review these fees annually.


A business that wishes to opt out of the collection service and avoid paying the associated fee must notify the town in writing no later than March 1, 2021.


If a business does choose to opt out, it will be obliged to transport its own garbage to the Cape Ray Waste Transfer Station and pay the tipping fee, which will remain unchanged at $164 per tonne.",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Lt. Maurice Collins of the Salvation Army cannot heap enough praise on the residents and businesses of the Southwest Coast for their generosity over the Christmas holidays.


“We were anticipating to be down but we were actually up,” said Collins. “It’s so positive. They are such generous people, giving people and want to help out their neighbours. I am just blown away by the support.”


Support also came from community partners, local churches and area businesses who raised money in-house and then donated cheques, or even large items such as freezers to help out with food storage. Donations typically drop after the holiday season, but Collins hopes that level of support will enable the Salvation Army to continue assisting families around the region.


“It’s hard to predict what’s going to happen. It’s hard to know what the need is going to be, but all indications show that the need is going to be up. We have been planning for that, but until you get into it you don’t know what the need is actually going to be,” he admitted. “I’m sure there will be difficult days ahead, but I’m sure we’ll be able to weather the storm no problem at all.”


Collins estimates that donations went up by roughly 20 percent, which is no small feat during a global pandemic. Feeding families was a bit costlier this year, and not just because food prices are up. Instead of the usual food baskets, the Salvation Army handed out gift cards.


“The cost of the gift cards were higher,” noted Collins. “But through the generosity of people in this area we met the need.”


The province is also kicking in $5000 so that the Salvation Army can purchase new equipment “to assist with the provision of Emergency Services”. Collins posted a letter announcing the donation of behalf of the Department of Justice and Public Safety to Facebook on Wednesday, Jan. 13.


“Thank you to Andrew Parsons for coordinating this grant from the government to enhance The Salvation Army’s work on the Southwest Coast. Thank you to Steve Crocker for making it happen,” wrote Collins.",

  body: "LATEST UPDATE: Thurday, Jan. 21:


Marine Atlantic's Corporate Communications Officer Darrell Mercer has advised that a second crew member has tested positive for COVID-19. As a result, the MV Blue Puttees will remain dockside in Nova Scotia and the MV Atlantic Vision will enter service this evening, Thursday, Jan. 21.

UPDATE as of Wednesday, Jan. 20:


Local sources have indicated that the crew member who tested positive for COVID-19 is not a resident of the Southwest Coast, nor even this province.


Responding to further inquiries, Corporate Communications Offer Darrell Mercer wrote via e-mail that, 'I can confirm that Nova Scotia public health is leading this contact tracing based upon where the employee is located.''


Passengers who travelled between North Sydney, Nova Scotia and Port aux Basques, Newfoundland between December 29, 2020 and January 16, 2021 are advised to contact their provincial health authority. In Newfoundland, travellers are advised to contact 811 to determine whether or not they require testing.


****


The MV Blue Puttees has been pulled from service after a crew member tested positive for COVID-19. The vessel is currently being held dockside in North Sydney, Nova Scotia to facilitate further testing, and contact tracing is also underway.


'Approximately 125 employees are being tested, with approximately 65 isolating on the ferry with the current shift. The crew member in question followed all COVID-19 protocols, including wearing a mask and working behind plexiglass barriers, but may have had limited interaction with customers and employees. Our understanding is that NS Public Health and NL Public Health will be issuing advisories to passengers for select dates to monitor their health and contact 811 for further advice,' stated Darrell Mercer, Corporate Communications Officer, via e-mail.


In a prepared statement, Marine Atlantic confirmed that officials from Nova Scotia Public Health had notified the Crown corporation about the positive test on Tuesday, Jan. 19. Prior to that announcement, social media had been circulating screenshots of a letter allegedly handed to passengers prior to boarding the Tuesday evening crossing.


“The Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador health authorities have identified, out of an abundance of caution, that all crew members who were on the vessel and completed their shift as well as all crew members currently on the vessel will be tested.”


According to the statement, the vessel itself will also undergo a through cleaning.

As a result of the testing, today’s scheduled crossing by the Puttees for the 11:45 North Sydney to Port aux Basques and 23:45 return trip have been cancelled. While the Blue Puttees remains tied up, the MV Highlanders will continue its run, and the MV Atlantic Vision will also slide into the schedule as required.


Keep checking back for updates as more information becomes available.

  subtitles: "Lloyd Taverner stands in front of the concrete garage that once housed generators for the telecommunications station at Red Rocks. - © Rosalyn Roy / Wreckhouse Press",
  body: "There have been a lot of changes to Red Rocks over the years, but it seems Lloyd Taverner remembers them all. During a walk-along tour of the area, Lloyd easily points to spots where the old telegraph poles were, where the generators sat, the name of the old “Peter Station” facility, and everything in between.


His father, Colin, was a diesel mechanic. He moved the family, including one-week-old Lloyd, to Red Rocks in 1952.  The area had been selected as base to construct a communications station for Terra Nova Tel, a subsidiary of Canadian National Telecommunications. They were the telephone company of the Dominion of Newfoundland from 1949 to 1988. 


“They looked after all the communications from here right to St. John’s,” says Lloyd.


What remains now are hollowed-out concrete ruins filled with brick fragments, peppered with graffiti (albeit some of it quite impressive) and little else. Nearby there are a few half-moon stands that once housed large fuel tanks to keep the generators running. Lloyd continues pointing to various spots, where components were placed, where poles were once raised.

“Right here is where the generators were,” he says. “Right here is where my house was.”


He grew up here, scampering around the grassy ridge close to the shoreline. He remembers watching his father at work.


Two duplexes once stood here, with separate apartments for the operator and four technicians who operated the telecommunications system along with their families.

Water was obtained by way of a pipe installed in the brook nearby, about a kilometre away. 


“There were four families here at all times, and my father was the diesel mechanic here,” he explains.


Lloyd recalls one night that lightning struck the nearby Cape Ray Lighthouse, but isn’t sure how old he was at the time. 


“We were in our bedroom watching it burn, and I guess they had some drums outside, gasoline or something and lightning hit it.”


A quick bit of research tells us that the lighthouse was damaged by fire in 1959. When the telecommunications facility switched to microwave technology, towers were installed, some of which are still there. It also had some added benefits for the families working there.


“We were top of the arc really, because we had power, we had television, before anyone else,” he chuckles. “We had top of the line.”


Being so close to the Table Mountains and the Wreckhouse area wasn’t without its risks either. 


“When they put in one of those towers, well it blew down. So then they put the buildings in, and they just put in metal type buildings, and my father looked at them and said, ‘Well you’re just wasting your time and wasting your money. It’s not going to stay there.’” 


Lloyd points to the concrete bunker style frames still standing.


“This is what they ended up putting in, there was that much wind.”


There used to be a wind gauge installed, and Lloyd remembers that they once recorded winds of 152 miles per hour (244 km per hour) blowing through.


“Thats when the gauge gave out. Well, it blew off!,” laughs Lloyd.


Being bored never seemed to be an issue growing up, even in such an unforgiving little pocket of land, but Lloyd says it was the least of their worries back then. Even the weather used to be different, harsher, more fierce. They would get socked in by snow and wind and go about their business anyway. 


“I remember my father had friends over to the lighthouse, and he got on a tractor and blew his way out there through a snowstorm just to have a game of cards!” 


These days ATVs roam up and down the gravel where the tracks used to run, but back then going anywhere meant hitching a ride on the train.


“If you wanted to go to Port aux Basques, you would just go out there and flag the train down. If they weren’t too busy they would stop and pick you up. We all used to do that.”


He recalls they loved to hop on the train to get to town, hoping to catch a movie sometimes, but he didn’t do it too often himself. Unfortunately, Lloyd remembers the sad death of a neighbour, who used to do just that. He ended up being struck by the train when he slipped while trying to step off the railway line.


“There was just no time for the train to stop.”


Initially the railway track used to run along the shoreline, but it eroded enough to necessitate a causeway. That seemed to mark the beginning of the end, says Lloyd, as not long after services began to shut down. 


The entire facility began fully shutting down when Lloyd turned 16, and his father bought one of the company houses for the princely sum of one dollar. The family moved it just down the road, just handy to the little wooden bridge.


Today, little remains of the communications station other than the concrete shells. There are no old houses, no long-forgotten furniture. That might be why most people who don’t know its history are under the impression that the area was a military facility of some kind. 


“That seems to be what most people think, and my brother said boy, thats history there, that’d make a good story.”


Lloyd has numerous fond memories of his time at the Red Rocks communications station, and is a diesel mechanic but spent most of his career working as a stevedore for the ferry service.


“I went into the mechanical side of things, and that was my main business.”


He also worked with the railway for fourteen years, until it also shut down. After 20 years as a stevedore, he retired last year. He has also been a member of the Rangers for the past 42 years, and still goes on three or four outings a year.


But the little shoreline spot is still there, still putting a “little taste of salt on your lips.”",

  body: "UPDATE as of Monday evening, Jan. 25th: On Monday, evening, January 25, Corporate Communications Officer advised that the MV Blue Puttees will return to service . The vessel will depart North Sydney on 11:45 a.m. Tuesday morning, January 26 and the MV Atlantic Vision will return to standby mode.


'All employees currently working on board the MV Blue Puttees have tested negative for COVID-19, confirmed through two separate tests as per Public Health recommendations. These employees are now able to return to regularly scheduled duties,' wrote Mercer.


'The public health agencies in both provinces continue to take the lead on contact tracing and the public health investigation. Marine Atlantic is providing support and assistance wherever possible.


PORT AUX BASQUES – On Tuesday night, Jan. 19, passengers boarding the MV Blue Puttees departing Newfoundland were handed a letter. Across the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Brandon Smith, a transport driver, was preparing to board the MV Highlanders in North Sydney.


“They passed out the letter around 10 o’clock that night, to everyone on the parking lot,” says Smith.


While Smith was not given the notice prior to boarding in Nova Scotia, his partner, who Smith did not identify, got one less than two hours before sailing on the Blue, which upset Smith a great deal.


“It’s absolutely ridiculous, that they sailed, knowing there was someone on that boat who was sick. It shouldn’t have happened.”


Smith shared his partners letter on Facebook Wednesday morning, and it rapidly gained traction. Not long after that, Marine Atlantic issued a statement confirming that a crew member on the Blue had tested positive for COVID-19.


According to the statement, Marine Atlantic had been notified by the Nova Scotia public health officials on Tuesday about the positive test. In order to facilitate testing of the rest of the crew and to begin contact tracing, the Blue was held dockside in North Sydney, and its crossings for Wednesday were cancelled. Crew members would also be required to isolate on the vessel.


Responding to inquiries, Darrell Mercer, Corporate Communications Officer, noted that upon receiving the letter, two customers had chosen to forego their trip on the Blue the previous night in favour of a later sailing on the MV Highlanders.


“Approximately 125 employees are being tested, with approximately 65 isolating on the ferry with the current shift. The crew member in question followed all COVID-19 protocols, including wearing a mask and working behind plexiglass barriers, but may have had limited interaction with customers and employees,” wrote Mercer via e-mail.


Mercer said that the crew member had first noticed symptoms after returning home following their shift. Addressing rumours about the employee’s place of residency, Mercer wrote, “Nova Scotia public health is leading this contact tracing based upon where the employee is located.”


“The individual did not leave the vessel during their entire shift onboard. He works in the Passenger Services department and due to the COVID-19 measures in place would have had limited contact with customers.”


By Thursday morning, testing on the remaining crew was complete, although the full results were not expected for at least another 24-48 hours. A second crew member, a resident of Central Newfoundland, had also tested positive.


Marine Atlantic issued another statement about this development.


“The individual, who is currently isolating at home, was part of the same shift as the previously infected employee. The public health agencies in both Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador continue to take the lead on contact tracing and the public health investigation. Marine Atlantic is providing support and assistance wherever possible.”


With the Blue tied up in Nova Scotia, Marine Atlantic scheduled the MV Atlantic Vision to fill in its slot.


“This is a challenging time for our employees and their families, and we will continue to work with them and provide support during this difficult period,” noted the statement.


That challenge was also being felt on the Southwest Coast of Newfoundland, where many of the ferry service’s employees reside. Mayor John Spencer, who is part of the town’s COVID-19 Committee, issued his own statement in support of Marine Atlantic’s response.


“The news of a positive virus test result of a vessel employee operated by Marine Atlantic Inc. comes as a shock, but not surprising, given these essential workers are on the frontline of a health crisis and are trying to contain a highly infectious disease that is currently dominating the global community with tragic consequences,” wrote Spencer.


He observed that with the slow down in air traffic and closure of routes, Marine Atlantic’s service is more important than ever. That service, however, means there is an inherent risk to the town and by extension the Southwest Coast region.


“Port aux Basques is a Gateway to the Province and as such, the majority of all ground transport comes through this town. This creates a certain amount of vulnerability, whether it is the simple gesture of grabbing a coffee or gassing up. We can never be too careful in looking out for the health and safety of each other. We care and residents care for the health and safety of all.”


The Mayor offered high praise to Marine Atlantic employees, but conceded, “We also have to be realistic. We know it does happen elsewhere. No matter how much effort we put into protecting each other there is always the possibility of a breach in protocol. One slip can be tragic.”


To date, the Southwest Coast has remained relatively unscathed through the global pandemic. There are no known cases of COVID-19 within the region, and Spencer implored residents to keep doing their part to avoid changing that.


“We are doing exceptionally well. We need to continue working and helping each other through the use of good hygiene, distancing, masks in indoor spaces and respect for each other... that (through) all of our collective efforts we do care about keeping our southwest communities virus-free.”


On Friday morning, Jan. 22, Mercer provided a status update regarding the crew of the Blue Puttees.


“It is our understanding that the testing is complete, we are just awaiting results. We are only aware of the two cases at this stage,” stated Mercer via e-mail.


On Friday morning, Mayor Spencer issued another statement of his own, this time to announce the temporary closure of the Bruce II Sports Centre while awaiting the remainder of the test results.


“The vulnerable population and vulnerability for community transmission rises when you consider PAB’s pivotal role as the main supply route for almost all goods and services to the province. Anyone entering and exiting the province by road comes through here. Staying safe using an over abundance of caution is not an unrealistic goal,” stated Spencer.

The town planned to re-examine the pause of the activities at the Bruce II on Sunday, Jan. 24.


Responding to inquiries, Spencer noted that the decision had come in consultation with the town’s COVID-19 Committee, and that there were no plans to close any additional facilities.

Tara Pye, Regional Director of Communications for Western Health, also responded to e-mail inquiries.


“There is capacity for COVID testing on the Southwest coast. Anyone involved in a COVID-19 case investigation will be contacted by public health. If individuals require testing, arrangements will be made.”


“In addition, the province has issued a public advisory for passengers who travelled on the Blue Puttees between Dec 29, 2020 and Jan. 16, 2020 to contact 811.”",

Jody Anderson of Port aux Basques was found guilty of two counts of Unlawfully causing an animal unnecessary suffering (CCC 2008 [445.1]) and one count of Injuring or endangering an animal (CCC 1985 [445.a]). Peter Rossiter of O’Regan’s was also convicted on one count of each of these charges.


Judge Lynn Cole convicted both on Dec. 2, 2020, and sentencing was scheduled for Stephenville court on Friday, Jan. 22, 2021. Instead both the Crown and defense attorneys agreed that a pre-sentence report was needed, and Cole agreed.


Velda Tapp Pretty of In Memory of Shadow Rescue has no problem with the delay.


“The pre-sentence report is a good thing. I am glad they’re doing it,” said Pretty, who testified at the trial.


Pretty, who was going to drive to Stephenville for the sentencing, won’t have as far to travel to hear Cole pass sentence on April 21st at 1:00 p.m. The Provincial Circuit Court returns to Port aux Basques in March following its usual winter hiatus.

  body: "Here’s what you need to know this week about the sports you love.




NHL Noise


A new hockey season wouldn’t be complete without rumours surrounding a few disgruntled players. This season’s drama features the Columbus Blue Jackets and Pierre-Luc Dubois. A first line centre. 22 years old and still rising. A 27-goal season already under his belt. Not too shabby.  


Dubois wants out of Columbus, and Coach John Tortorella is busy winning friends and influencing people, as per usual. The situation is messier than a gallon of manure in a quart jug.


There isn’t one NHL team that couldn’t use Dubois. But few have the assets necessary to acquire the game-breaker. Two Canadian teams are reported to be interested. 


The Winnipeg Jets have their own disgruntled star in Patrik Laine, and a swap of the two has been proposed by insiders. I’m not buying it. Columbus needs a centre coming back in the deal, and the Jets would be well advised to use their coveted trade chip on a top 4 defenceman. 


The Montreal Canadiens also have the kid on their radar. Dubois reportedly prefers to go home, and any time a local kid wants to play in Montreal… well, that’s a little like finding blood in the proverbial turnip. But for the first time in about a century the Habs are good, and they’re set down the middle. A tough call for the guy in charge. Something to keep an eye on for sure.


A week and a bit into NHL action, here’s a quick look at how I saw each Canadian team, from east to west.  


The Montreal Canadiens are reaping the benefits of an industrious off-season. They can score goals with aplomb, which the Habs have lacked since Moses was in the basket, and rookie Alexander Romanov is showing potential to become a top pair defenceman. 


In Ottawa, the Senators are playing with a chip on their shoulder. Projected to finish last in the division, the Sens upset the Leafs and took the Jets to overtime. There may be a surprise or two from this well-coached mishmash of high picks and reclamation projects.


If you were to listen to the locals the Toronto Maple Leafs have already hoisted the cup and we missed the parade because our masks were riding high. What actually happened? Austin Matthews hit the ground running, while rookie Nick Robertson is out for four weeks after suffering a knee injury.


Winnipeg Jets sniper Patrik Laine suffered an upper body injury in the first week and is day-to-day in a season where every single day counts, and in the last season of his current contract. The Jets have two overtime wins early. 


In Edmonton the Oilers are missing Oscar Klefbom, and GM Ken Holland missed the memo that goalie depth might be a good idea for a compressed season. 


The Flames in Calgary were lit with a blasty bough and they have two wins and a loser point in an overtime loss to start the season. New arrival Jacob Markstrom is the story there, with a .935 save percentage in his first three starts.


The Vancouver Canucks watched a significant contingent of their team head to Calgary in the off-season. This year their story is youth. They skate like the wind, but their record reflects some growing pains.




Raptors Racket


The Toronto Raptors have been able to string together some wins and are slowly climbing up from the basement. Fred VanVleet appears to have woken up nicely, and OG Anunoby has been reliable defensively. 


The Raps are lacking depth up front. Coach Nick Nurse said, “I think there’s still some depth concerns… I think it’s a bigger-ish type player that we would look to add at some point.” Sounds like the guys they let walk in the off-season. 




Blue Jays Babble


The Toronto Blue Jays landed the biggest fish on the free agent market this past week, signing elite centre-fielder George Springer to a six-year $150 million deal. Known for his homerun prowess, Springer is also expected to strengthen the Jays outfield. Springer was the 2017 World Series MVP for the Houston Astros and has been an important fixture in the Astros line up since 2014. 


The deal is not without controversy. Springer was involved in the Astros sign stealing scandal from the 2017 and 2018 seasons, leading to severe sanctions from MLB including heavy fines and the forfeiture of top draft picks.


Toronto also came to terms with relief pitcher Kirby Yates on a one-year deal and are reportedly in the market to add a starting pitcher.




Superbowl Squawks


It’s that time of year.


The road to the Super Bowl is clearly mapped out with NFL Conference Championship games being set. On January 24th the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will be in Green Bay to face the Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs will welcome the Buffalo Bills.


In the NFC the storyline is Tom Brady, wearing Buccaneers Red instead of Patriots Blue, going up against another elite quarterback, Aaron Rodgers. The QB duel for the AFC Championship was undetermined at press deadline. The question lies in whether Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes will clear concussion protocol, or if the Bills’ Josh Allen will face a back up. 


By the time you’re reading this, you’ll know who is meeting on February 7th for Super Bowl LV, and this seems like as good a time as any to remind local grocers to load up on wings. 


Lori Bennett is a social worker, policy professional, recreation softball player and coach, and new ukulele-ist.

  subtitles: "From left: Andrew Furey, Andrew Parsons, and Dr. David Thomas talk to reporters at the Hotel Port aux Basques on Tuesday, Jan. 19. - René J. Roy / Wreckhouse Press",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – A Newfoundland and Labrador Liberal red tour bus emblazoned with Premier Andrew Furey’s face rolled into the Hotel Port aux Basques parking lot on Tuesday morning, Jan. 19. With the provincial election underway, the campaign is making scheduled stops across the island, including along the Southwest Coast.


Part of Furey’s election pitch includes eHealth and telemedicine delivery for more rural population areas. Specifically, Furey wants to invest in technology and IT training, including on-site IT support. The cost savings from shifting to this model will then be reinvested to expanded subsidies for more rural residents to travel for specialized healthcare. 


“Expanding eHealth/telemedicine services means decreasing travel time and costs, while increasing access to services – which is paramount for rural areas of the province.”


Furey also hopes to avoid the added stress of avoidable travel to patients and caregivers.

“I’ve been on the other side of that, and I can see how you can do that virtually now,” said Furey.


He also praised Dr. David Thomas, Chief of Staff at Dr. Charles L. LeGrow Medical Centre, with taking the initiative to start a Facebook Live podcast to help deliver necessary information to residents.


Part of the plan is to facilitate medical care in communities that may have only one doctor or nurse servicing the area. Instead of being cut off with only books to refer to, the medical personnel would be able to stay connected.


“Sometimes doctors or nurses resist going to communities because they don’t feel supported,” noted Furey. “Now you can be online and with a virtual consult with a specialist in St. John’s or in Corner Brook fairly quickly.”


He noted that virtual care isn’t going to replace patient-doctor contact entirely, but it will eliminate one element of it. When an in-person visit is required, it may include a team system, wherein a local medical provider completes the physical exam and consults with the specialist virtually.


“This time of disruption has allowed us to recognize the power of integration, and one of the tools at our fingertips to do that is electronic health,” said Furey.


That may include increasing technical support and training.


“I’d like to think now that your healthcare team is going to be a doctor, nurse, Allied health and tech support, and that’s what we’re kind of committed to.”


For remote communities hoping to attract doctors, Furey promises to continue working with Memorial University and MNLA to develop physician recruitment and retention programs.


“That’s kind of one of the issues that is facing young grads as they emerge from medical school is the romantic notion of being an isolated practitioner. Even in an urban setting, frankly, is no longer appealing. They want the work-life balance.”


Mayor John Spencer is worried about people falling through the cracks.


“The virtual model introduced was never virtual in scope, occurring primarily over the telephone. My own experience as a cancer patient is an example. My physical trip to see the specialist was replaced by a telephone call – a how is it going?,” shared Spencer via e-mail. But he does see the potential too.


“Anything to save money and travel time to avoid trips across the island for specialist services taking ten minutes or to travel to St. John’s to discover a scheduled appointment has been cancelled would be a vast improvement,” wrote Spencer. “There are other times, with the support of a local doctor, nurse practitioner or nurse being present where a virtual meet can be assist in patient care. Our medical system needs to find a healthy balance.”",

  body: "Hurwitz’s protagonist begins with the requisite tragic background as a kind of Orphan X, a child brought up and trained as a covert assassin. This Nowhere Man operates in the shadowy universe of black ops, eliminating targets deemed dangerous to the government.


In this, the second and final book in this short series, Into the Fire chronicles the efforts of this Nowhere Man to help a man whose life is in shambles and is being threatened by unknown forces.


In the vein of superheroes like The Avengers and lone wolf antiheroes like The Equalizer, Evan Smoak is a former assassin who had worked secretly to eliminate government targets. But he has now gone off the reservation and is trying to redeem himself by helping people who are in dire need through no fault of their own.

However, this hero is more than just a little over the top.

He is a truly incredible person, with unlimited funds available, and equipped with gadgets that even Q of the James Bond series would never have dreamed up.


In addition he had a retinue of incredibly capable hangers-on such as a hacker extraordinaire, an armorer/mechanic and others. Smoak, meanwhile, is first introduced as a cross between James Bond and Ethan Hunt (of the Mission Impossible series) on steroids.  

In fairness it should be noted that Mr. Hurwitz, also author of The Prodigal Son, has an excellent command of the written word.


Also, I must add that the book does provide a continuous menu of titillating adventures, has unpredictable outcomes in several situations, as well as surprising and well-crafted villains. Thus, in spite of all his skills and resources, Smoak still finds himself fighting for his own survival.


Perhaps one of the most redeeming qualities of the book is in the struggle of the hapless target of these would-be assassins. He eventually discovers himself to be a worthwhile man, after his marriage collapsed following a miscarriage and he lost all confidence in himself. And he finally does recover his pride and reconnect with his wife. Fittingly, Smoak eventually decides to retire from these extracurricular activities.


Aficionados of the genre may find Into the Fire quite entertaining but I found it to have pacing problems.



At times I found the novel slowing down and faltering as Hurwitz descended into overly long descriptions that served little purpose or had nothing to do with the action. The introduction of the characters took an inordinate amount of time and space, three chapters actually, and I found the skills and gadgets of the protagonist overwhelmingly improbable and quite impossible to overlook.",

  body: "It should come as no surprise that the topic of the pandemic should appear in this column. Seeing as I spent six weeks last summer in the Codroy Valley in what was a virtual virus-free environment, the daily news of Ontario’s pandemic challenges is a big contrast to life in Newfoundland.


While you deal with virus numbers in single digits (if any at all) we here in Ontario are seeing numbers spiking in the thousands. As I write our numbers are an average of 3,000 cases a day and often exceeding 100 cases in the City of Ottawa. Long term care homes have been particularly hard hit and daily death counts are downright scary. 


We are now in a state of emergency, with text and radio alerts telling us to stay home. Schools are closed. Premier Doug Ford is pulling what hair he has left by imploring people to stay put and follow health protocols.


The vaccine is here, but what’s available for the next while will not really do the job. The big quantity of doses that we were hoping to get won’t come for another month or so. There’s lots to worry about.


Our Newfoundland compatriot, former General Rick Hillier, is in charge of distribution and logistics for the vaccine here in Ontario. As usual he lends an air of competence and frank talk to the situation.


We are constantly reading and hearing of the long term impacts of the pandemic, i.e. working from home and travel restrictions come to mind. It is claimed that once this all passes, probably 30% of the workforce will continue working from home.

You can be sure there are many people who are well fed up working this way. But if nothing else, the acceptance of remote working is here to stay.


That is not a bad thing.


One time if you asked your boss to consider this as a viable alternative, you would get kicked out of the office for such a proposition. That is less likely to occur now and it is about time.

The business travel and leisure/tourism market, on which Newfoundland so heavily relies, may take years to return. Business travel that was a staple for airlines has evaporated. A Zoom business meeting replaces in-person meetings, conventions and the like.


There may be some resilience here but much of that practice is here to stay. I suspect the upcoming tourism season in the province will not be great – two years in a row. I pity the tourism operators that rely on a busy summer season. The airlines are abandoning routes to the province so the airports are taking a beating. The smaller regional ones are in jeopardy all across the Atlantic provinces. 


Something that got my attention recently is the movement of people away from urban areas to work remotely in more rural locations. A lot is being written about it, especially as it relates to the larger cities.


One question is how widespread is this and can smaller regions benefit?


The work-from-home practice is pretty evident in Ottawa as the ridership on buses and trains has nosedived. Our major highways throughout the city that are often full of traffic snarls in the morning and evening are mostly gone now.


The poor traffic reporters, who are a big part of the radio shows, have a lot less to say. City buses go around in circles practically empty. We have light rail trains that are being extended farther out to the edges of the city and you wonder will they be filled.


Will workers want to go back to the inner city offices once the pandemic is over? Will they need to?


There is evidence that mid-career or soon-to-retire folks in big cities are selling their houses and moving out. It seems Toronto and Montreal have seen this in big numbers.

Anecdotally, I hear Halifax is experiencing a hot housing market. Might it possibly be influenced by people who can work remotely and are choosing to live there?


I saw in the news a couple who made the choice to live in Newfoundland for family reasons and now find they are able to perform their jobs from there. With Newfoundland’s declining population, it would be great if we could find a way to entice people from the big cities to relocate to the province.


Is there any sense to the argument that what might start as a summer vacation by some folks could end up being a more permanent arrangement? Is that far fetched?


City dwellers do like their amenities though – good cell phones and fast internet service.

Would a quieter lifestyle and affordable housing be a good replacement?


Maybe it’s just wishful thinking on a snowy day in Ottawa.


While I look out the window at a slower city and daily life, I envy my friends in Newfoundland. My frequent visits to a nearby mall here have ended. Local eateries are takeout only or are closed.


Spare us a thought, will you, while we get through this?",

  body: "Editor’s note: MAiD, the acronym for Medical Assistance in Dying, became legal in Canada in 2016. A person with a grievous and irremediably medical condition where death is reasonably foreseeable can choose to seek medical assistance in dying. This is the third and final part of the story of Norman Osmond, who chose MAiD as his last wish.
  
  
  
  It was now a Thursday in August – the Chosen Day.


Thursday was also the day for each of the local grocery stores to put on the weekly specials. Norm was in his chair, dressed in his Sunday Best. As he glanced across at the flyers, there was an utterance that he would not be needing anything this week. Norm’s gift of ‘one liners’ had not been beaten by the deadly turmoil from within.


It was a magnificent morning.


Time did not stand still. Everything was targeted around the arrival of the medical team. A first visit was scheduled for midmorning. Medical lines, one primary and one secondary, had to be in place. Norm’s scheduled procedure was for 1 p.m. 


As the morning unfolded, Norm’s family arrived. There were other visitors as well, including his lifelong neighbours who, throughout his short ordeal, had been checking on him daily. The number of times this wonderful neighbourhood delivered food and other acts of kindness in support of Norm and his family was beyond measure.


Today, sadly, it was time for Norm to return a thank you and a last goodbye.


It was a morning of stories – Norm in his chair with family close by. A grandchild too young to stay, cradled in her Mom’s arms, huddled close by her Pop. Saying goodbye was going to be difficult. The departure of Jessica and her mom, Tracy, brought silence, as no one seemed to know how to pick things up after a tearful goodbye. 


Throughout the morning Norm had broken many of the silent moments with gestures, relieving a sense of tension within the living room. At one point, Norm even suggested that maybe someone should turn on the TV to get the hockey scores.


Norm was a great Bruins fan. He and I had joked what would happen if the Bruins advanced deep into the playoffs. Probably MAiD would be off the table.


Another of those light moments, just one of many along this short but agonizing journey.

The medical team returned again, close to the chosen time. Again, the question was asked relating to Norm’s wishes. The doctor spoke up, stating the procedure did not need to happen today, or any other day.


It was up to Norm, and he had made his decision.


Later the question was repeated as the drugs were prepared, on whether permission was granted to proceed.


“Green light all the way,” echoed softly throughout the room.


Norm fell into a deep sleep. Marion, the love of his love, sat next to him, and held his hand.

Norm was at peace. No more pain. No more suffering. Head to one side, eyes closed. No different a pose than the hundreds of sleeps he had drifted into sitting in that chair watching the evening news.


The physical Norm was at rest. The spiritual Norm was released to remain in hearts forever.

It was now time for family to say goodbye.


No one was in a hurry. This was family time with a loved one. The next couple of hours with Norm were treasured. Norm’s granddaughter, Beth, mother to Norm’s great-grandchild, Nash, moved to her Pop, taking his hand trying and desperately to fight back her tears. 

Norm’s other grandson, Cody, sat with his Dad. Both hearts were wrenching.


Thoughts quickly came of their home in Halifax where Norm’s fourth grandchild, Fallon and her Mom, Glenda, were feeling their own pain. Fallon was so special.


Norm could hardly speak about her without filling up inside. A love chain growing stronger with each passing day. Fallon’s heart shattered in grief. Around the room, voices could be heard as the family shared their memories, their stories. Each was their own way of celebrating a life.


Eventually, it was only Marion and her boys, Shawn and Jan, in the living room with their Dad. Marion would be the last to leave, sitting alone with him.


For Marion, after nearly six decades of marriage, having to say farewell to her love, her soul mate, the one person who walked the road of life with her more than anyone else, could not have been easy. However, she was not alone. Norm would always be with her. As Marion left, the door to the home that Norm built was closed.


Norm was still in his chair.


But the house was not empty. Norm was still in control.


His wish and his decision to remain home, passing peacefully on his own terms and surrounded by the love of family, had been respected.",

That can be fantastic when you want to vent, or blast off at something in the news that really bothers you. I do it myself, although I tend to be a little more reserved now that I am a bit more in the public eye. You can be silly, poignant or simply have the right gimmick. 


Having the chance to criticize a political policy or a bad burger from a fast food joint has never really been easier. All you have to do is log onto Facebook or Twitter. 


But social media, even a platform such as YouTube, can be rife with misinformation, skewed viewpoints, or just plain old lies designed to lure you into clicking on the page. Views equal revenues.


I recently was scrolling through Facebook, and a video came up showing me how one particular vlogger was a “crab-eating vlogger” who makes about 1.3 million a year through sponsorship deals. She cooks enormous crab meals – think 10 pounders – and eats them on screen. Thats it. Thats all she does.


I think I’m in the wrong line of work.


Anyway, she goes on to explain her process for luring people onto her page, which is the thumbnail. She places the cooked crab close to the camera, up chest high, to make it look like she has caught and cooked something from a King Kong movie. 


Then she says, she never eats the whole thing – usually just a pound or so. If I’m bothering to click on a video to watch someone eat, then eat. Don’t cook a huge meal and then just choke down a claw or two.  But this is a perfect example of the power of social media. A little picture can make you a million dollars a year.


Insanity. 


Facebook isn’t exactly exempt from the sensationalism of “but wait theres more” gimmicks either. The giant social media platform can track what you shop for from your laptop or phone thanks to a little hidden disclosure in the terms and conditions you electronically sign when you create your account. 


I went shopping for a laser printer last month and apparently Facebook thinks I am planning to corner the market on printers now since all of the ads I see are for printers. (Pro tip: you can disable Facebook page tracking in your settings.) It’s also not just videos and advertising that can be click baited into your face – it’s your own personal property. 


In that same Facebook terms and conditions page that we all clicked on without reading (don’t pretend you did), there is one in particular that is simply incredible. It states that “Facebook receives a non-exclusive transferable sub-licensable royalty-free worldwide license to use any photo on your account.” So while they don’t get to own your photos, they can do pretty much whatever they want with them. And you never get a dime.


I do recall a woman in the U.S.A. a few years back who was shocked to see a photo of herself and her infant son on a billboard. Upon investigation, she learned of that royalty-free worldwide photo policy and was told there was nothing to be done.


I’m not trying to give you all of this information to scare you off of the internet. That would be terrible, as it can be a wonderful resource. 


When I am watching a movie or reading something with my son and he asks me a question I don’t know the answer to, my immediate response is “Lets find out.” I consider the internet an incredible tool for learning. But it needs to be tempered with discretion when it comes to believing what you see. 


I suspect that a lot of us get taken in by the little chain letters that go around social media a lot. “I bought too many cars, so I’ll give one away to the one who reposts first” is one such example. If you know the small retailer and it’s legit, then go for it. Otherwise it’s best to remain cautious. 


A little attention to the finer details can be applied to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter in the same way we identify a spam email. If the spelling looks wrong, we know not to click on it, download or open any attachments. 


But if it's on a popular platform we seem to forget to use our caution and logic. 

If social media wants to gain a reputation as a reliable source of information then it ceases to be a social media platform and becomes a defacto news site. That would subject it to checks, balances and the usual journalistic standards, which is not what the platform is designed for.


Social media is designed to allow us to be social from the comfort of our homes, or to have fun. But it’s on us to know exactly what it is we are signing up for. 

In the future, you just might want to read the fine print after all.",

  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The Western Health testing site for COVID-19 will get a new home in downtown Port aux Basques.


“Given the change in weather, over the next several weeks Western Health will be moving the testing to an indoor location at 28 Main Street,” stated Tara Pye, Communications Director for Western Health, via-email.


That’s the address of the small taxi stand next to the Butterfly Book Boutique on Main Street. The current mobile testing is little more than a windbreak in the parking lot of MP Place behind the RCMP building in Grand Bay West. That makes for a cold experience for both staff and those waiting to be tested. 


Those same staff will conduct the testing at the new location, and will also likely be able to provide rapid testing, given they will have a proper facility to do so, although that information has not yet been confirmed. 


Neither has the hours of operation, with Pye explaining, “The hours of operation at the testing site will depend on the number of tests scheduled. As well, additional staff may be hired for COVID testing if required.” 


The announcement of a new testing site comes shortly after a surge in testing thanks to the recent diagnosis that a crewmember on the Blue Puttees had tested positive. Anyone who traveled on the vessel over the holidays was urged to get a test done. 


The staff conducting the tests was forced to walk throughout the parking lot in full winter gear, from one vehicle to another, with little protection from bitter cold and winds. With the promise of a more pleasant indoor facility, the process will likely prove a bit easier to manage as well as more comfortable. 


Individuals can call 811 or access the online self-assessment tool to determine if they should be tested for COVID-19. Individuals will be contacted by public health to book an appointment if a COVID test is required.

  body: "After speaking with Liberal Party leader Andrew Furey during his recent visit to the Southwest Coast, we reached out to PC Leader Ches Crosbie with the same two questions. Mr. Crosbie replied via e-mail during his West Coast campaign trip last week.



Q: What, if anything, are you doing to attract doctors to more rural areas since there simply aren’t enough, including in our region?


A. We commit to take the advice of the Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Association to create a province-wide program of primary health care teams:

• where patients receive comprehensive care;

• where family physicians can transition away from solo practice to team practice;

• where nurse practitioners, registered nurses and other providers can be connected and integrated with family doctors in team structures;

• where patients can have a continuous relationship with their own “most responsible provider”;

• where the progress we have made in electronic medical records and virtual care can be harvested for integrated team care; and where the focus can shift to wellness and disease prevention.


As well, we will heed the NLMA’s advice to set the goals of reducing the proportion of unattached patients in the province to 5 per cent and retaining 75 per cent of Memorial medical graduates who pursue family medicine.


It is imperative that we take this approach because there is something fundamentally wrong when 90,000 people do not have access to a family doctor. Every resident of the province should have access to a family doctor.


To ensure all residents can access quality and timely health care, a PC Government will introduce a health care team model. This delivery model will provide residents with access to family doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, occupational therapists and dieticians. Health care teams will offer after-hour and weekend clinics as well as virtual care.


We will work with communities, doctors, and the NLMA to focus on the recruitment of family doctors. We will also develop a more robust retention structure for graduating physicians of the Memorial University Medical School and provide attractive reimbursement/taxation packages for those who choose to practice in the province, particularly in rural Newfoundland and Labrador.




Q: Every federal government, regardless of who formed it, has broken their promise to not increase rates for the Marine Atlantic ferry service, and the taxpayer burden on this province in enormous. What, if anything, will you do to try to reduce that burden?


A. A PC government will work to lower Marine Atlantic ferry rates that raise the cost of living in Newfoundland and Labrador, make businesses less competitive and hurt tourism.

As the question acknowledges, Marine Atlantic is the responsibility of the federal government. But that does not mean we can’t hold them accountable to provide affordable and reliable service. In fact, it is their constitutional duty to so do. A PC government will work with the federal government and press them to keep rates as low as possible. Ottawa must step up and not ignore our province.


Editor’s note: As of publication deadline, PC candidates Ethan Maxwell Wheeler-Park (Burgeo - LaPoile) and Gary W. Bishop (St. George’s - Humber) had not responded to repeated requests for interviews. NDP candidate Judy Vanta (Burgeo - La Poile) also did not respond to our inquiries.

  subtitles: "",
  body: "Operation Wormwood: The Reckoning is a rare treat, offering a host of interesting and well-rounded, compelling characters caught up in bizarre circumstances.


The novel’s protagonist is Sgt. Nick Myra of the RNC in Newfoundland. Myra is investigating the mysterious illness called Wormwood that appears to affect only pedophiles. Symptoms of Wormwood include severe nosebleeds, excessive pain and insatiable thirst. With the help of Cst. Morgan and other colleagues within the RCMP, Myra is hot on the trail to discover who or what is responsible for all the patients succumbing to this dreadful disease. 


Father Peter Cooke is just back from Rome and he intends to bringing people, all people, all races, all sexes, straight, gay or otherwise, rich or poor back to the Catholic Church, especially the young people.


Kathie Fagan, formerly Sister Pius of the Catholic Church, has recently retired and is planning to make good use of her time by starting a support group for members of the force and the medical workers who deal with trauma, including job-related suicide and PTSD. Her son who she gave up for adoption, Father Charles Horan, had taken his own life after handing over important church files to Sgt. Myra that help him on his quest. 


Caught up in the whole mess are prominent and respected members of society, including Kevin Macy, Child Psychiatrist, who faces serious charges involving child pornography.

Minister of Health, Ronald McKenzie ends up on the Wormwood ward but signs himself out when his entourage shows up to whisk him to the airport on a private plane. Typically he leaves a sizeable donation to the hospital.


Joseph Franklyn, a 19-year-old also ends up on the ward and there is no evidence to suggest he is a pedophile. In fact, he is the victim of one – his mother – so why is he showing symptoms?


The story really takes off once Kathie Fagan begins settling in to retirement, moving into the house her mother left her. After the renovations have been done she is looking to do some good for people. In light of her son’s death she wants to give back. Since Sgt. Myra is one of those suffering from severe PTSD and she feels this is a good place to start. 


Meanwhile the hospital staff are working hard to keep up with the influx of patients that keep showing up with symptoms of Wormwood. There is talk that maybe it is not God’s doing after all, that maybe there is a serial killer on the loose, but how is it that this is happening all over the world? Is it a ring of murderers connected across the globe?


It comes to light that “thujone”, a derivative of the wormwood plant, when administered in small intermittent doses causes all of the symptoms that the patients have been exhibiting. Who is making this serum and how is it getting administered to the patients under medical care? Who decides who will be next?


It is has also been discovered that the Catholic Priests who hear confessions from these pedophiles keep a secret list. But where are these lists kept? And how is thujone being transported around the world?


All these questions needs answering and Sgt. Myra is a compelling protagonist doing just that. His journey is one of mystery and madness, one that takes the reader to an ending that no one could foresee! This book is a must-read!


I give it 5 stars!",

    subtitles: "Melissa Samms is the NDP candidate for St. George’s - Humber. - courtesy of Melissa Samms",
    body: "CODROY VALLEY – Melissa Samms says that their first run for public office has been a long time coming. Samms first became interested after attending youth parliament, and went on to study political science at university.


“Everything political is personal,” said Samms via phone interview on Tuesday, Jan. 26.


Property owners are subject to real estate legislation, for example. Motorists must comply with federal and provincial regulations.


Speaking of roads, Samms has identified problem areas in Codroy. It makes sense, given that they live there.


Samms says that the problem is the old road was installed with improper drainage, and the section that was paved this past summer was simply put down right on top of the already crumbling pavement. Couple that with transport trucks heading to and from the fish plant or dairy farms and it’s not hard to understand why the roads are in such a poor condition.

Since the Codroy Valley is a local service district and not a municipality, they don’t get as much funding for infrastructure. Samms would like to see that changed, if only because poor roads becomes a safety issue and can hinder first responders.


That’s another problem too – the chronically understaffed ambulance service. Samms realizes that’s a provincial issue and not exclusive to the Valley, but observes, “We still have to do something about it.”


A community approach, coming together to find solutions, is what Samms is focused on. The Leading Edge Credit Union is looking at the possibility of developing co-operative housing the Valley, for example. Housing, or rather the lack of rental properties, is another problem Samms has identified.


One person Samms has spoken with has been looking for a new rental for about a year, and another has been looking for six months. One landlord has repaired the septic system, but won’t pay to fix half the broken heaters in a rental unit. The lack of alternative places to rent means people have little recourse, and turning to a provincial rental board can have an impact on the renter’s social life. Perhaps one of the larger issues Samms is focused on is food sustainability.


“We import 71% of the food we eat,” begins Samms.


What the province does import typically has a two or three day shelf life, notes Samms. Given that the Codroy Valley has such a rich ecosystem and that the riding as a whole has such a solid history of food production, that seems unnecessary. But that’s not to say large scale farms are the way to go either.

“I don’t agree with the industrialization of food,” says Samms.


Ideally, Samms would like to see hobby farmers receive grants to purchase equipment or livestock. Many in the Valley have inherited land that can sustain them, but lack funding support unless they take out a loan, and even those are usually only designed to help larger producers.


Even if hobby farmers do get funding, they need to be able to get their wares to consumers. Some stores in the area do promote locally grown or produced foods and goods, but a previous attempt at a farmer’s co-op has left some producers gun shy. Samms thinks a farmer’s market might be a better route instead.


Then there are the tourism opportunities that exist, should COVID-19 ever allow for that industry to re-start. In addition to the world-renowned bird sanctuary, there are outfitters that offer year-round excursions, and out-of-province residents who just like to summer in the Codroy Valley too.


An old carding mill is testament to the quality of goods the Valley used to produce. These days fabrics tend to be imported, but there are opportunities for growth on a sustainable level.


Notes Samms, “Economic diversification is incredibly important for St. George’s-Humber. I would love to see more direct investment in sustainable agriculture through grants, particularly for small farms; reduced taxes for already existing small businesses; and serious investment in secondary processing, such as the work being done at Codroy Seafoods, who produce many market-ready products.”


While Samms is from the Codroy Valley and sees opportunity there, that does not mean they have any less desire or commitment to serve the rest of the riding. Samms is working on outreach to the rest of the district, a task hindered by the current pandemic and the necessary protocols.


“I don’t know what the issues are there, but I want to know,” says Samms. Only then can Samms work on addressing those too.


Part of that outreach work has already begun. Samms has created a Facebook page to answer questions and be available to voters who want to know more. In addition to fielding questions, Samms has also provided links to reference material about food sustainability.

Beginning on Tuesday night, Jan. 26, Samms began livestreaming, and plans to update her Facebookpage daily, schedule permitting. Campaigning is time consuming, especially during a pandemic.


That’s a bit worrisome. Normally voters in need of a ride to get to a voting booth would get offers from candidates and volunteers. That’s just not possible, even on the Southwest Coast that has yet to record a single case.


“There’s a risk of community exposure,” observes Samms.


Instead, they’re pushing constituents to apply for a mail-in ballot instead, and that is exactly how Samms plans to vote. The deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot is Tuesday, Feb. 2 by 4:00 p.m. Voters can register online or by calling 1-877-729-7987.


Samms ends the interview with a passionate statement about indigenous rights that simultaneously offers a glimpse into some personal history.


“Regarding indigenous rights in Ktaqmkuk (Newfoundland), it’s vital for us to recognize the autonomy, culture, and knowledge held by indigenous people in St. George’s-Humber. We have a strong indigenous history in the region between us L’nuk / Mi’kmaq, and the Beothuck. Mollichignick brook on the way to South Branch is named for a Beothuck woman who lived upstream sometime in the 1800s, according to oral history. My grandfather made all his own wraparound moccasins, and while he never said she was a witch, he said my grandmother could cast a spell - something indigenous women in Katalisk Sipu (Codroy Valley) were known for, along with basket weaving!",

      subtitles: "From left: Charles Gillman (Senior Geologist), Keith Bowes (Project Manager), Adam Kiley (Business Development / Corporate), Warren Potma (Exploration Manager) and Ian Murray (Executive Chairman) are based in Perth, Australia. - courtesy of Matador Mining",
      body: "PERTH, AUSTRALIA – It’s a brilliant, sunny day in Australia according to Warren Potma and Keith Bowes of Matador Mining. The two are in short-sleeves and looking tanned during a video chat about Matador’s Cape Ray Gold Project on Thursday evening, Jan. 21 (Newfoundland time). With a 14.5 hour time difference, that means it’s already Friday morning in Australia. But if they have their way, they’ll soon bundle up into warmer clothes and head back to Newfoundland to get back to work on their company’s worksite located near Isle aux Morts. 


Thanks to the pandemic, neither Potma nor Matador’s Senior Geologist, Charles Gillman, were able to make it into the province and get to the site. This year, if granted permission by provincial health authorities, Gillman will travel here in March and Potma will follow in April. Even without a site visit by senior personnel, the company still made significant progress.


“We had a really good year in the end, despite COVID’s best attempt to scuttle us. We had a bit of a late start to drilling,” offers Potma, Matador’s Exploration Manager. “We had a big crew on site, and last year was the first year where we employed a relatively new batch of people from the local communities in labouring roles on the job. We’re looking forward to increasing those numbers this coming year.”


Potma promises that there’s going to be a lot more work on the ground this year. The work will be low impact, but it will cover a much larger area.


“We’re really stepping up the exploration side of things,” says Potma. “Last year we had our first new discovery on the project in 20 years.”


When Matador first picked up the Cape Ray project, all of the existing resources were already known, and the previous owners had effectively confined drilling to known resources. Last year and for the first time, Matador went exploring to new greenfields to identify new targets.


“We made an announcement, I think it was September last year, of the Angus discovery,” says Potma. “It was a really important new discovery for us, demonstrating that there’s a lot of opportunity on this project.”


Buoyed by the discovery, Matador Mining then upped their marketing to reflect that potential. The company owns 120 kilometres of strike length of the project area.


“All of the existing resources sit within 15 kilometres strike length of that, and outside of that there’s only 20 drill holes for the remaining 105 kilometres of project, which is ridiculous,” explains Potma.


He points out that if the site were located in Australia instead, hosting both the Cape Ray and Marathon deposits, it would be peppered with drill holes.


“To have a project like this, that’s only got 20 drill holes in 105 kilometres of a structure like that, sitting under really thin cover, for us is just massively exciting,” says Potma.


A much more thorough exploration of the remaining strike area is planned. Matador suspects but doesn’t yet know whether or not there’s even more gold deposits to be found within the remaining 105 kilometres, but they intend to find out.


“I think for the first time we’re actually looking for it in a systematic manner, and we’re looking along the entire length of the structure, and I would be very surprised if there isn’t significant additional mineralization along that structure given what we know Marathon have got, given what we know we’ve got, and given that there’s been no effective exploration of the ground between the two of us,” says Potma.


Exploring for potential deposits used to require diamond drilling, but Matador uses a single-person portable drill rig that can get through the thin cover to a depth of about eight metres. The plan is to use the portable rig systematically over the next couple of years to effectively map the remainder of the project.


“It’s going to take a while because it’s quite a big area to cover,” concedes Potma. “But we’ve got a number of priority projects. We’ll hit 12 of those, sort of four to six square kilometre areas, this coming year.”


That means the company will need skilled geologists and some field helpers, and that translates into job opportunities for residents of the Southwest Coast. Last year, Matador advertised for three helpers and were overwhelmed by the response. Potma estimates the company received in excess of 50 applications.


“We weren’t able to employ all of them last year, but this year we will be employing more and more of those local people who want to work on the project,” promises Potma.


Matador is also hoping to train employees for other roles beyond field work.


“There’s a whole branch of different jobs both in the field and in the core shed that we can see the local community, who may not have geological training, can still be involved in that work,” says Potma. “You don’t have to be a trained operator to be very handy in jobs like this. There’s a lot of physical work to be done.”


Outside of keeping the senior team from reaching the site, COVID has also delayed the company’s ability to complete its environmental impact study (EIS). Matador has been granted an extension through to August 24, 2021, but Bowes believes that they will require an additional extension beyond that date.


“We have the ability to extend it by one more year,” says Bowes. “I think we’ll probably be submitting early next year.”


Part of the EIS means liaising with community stakeholders, and given the need for social distancing and the large time difference, even Zoom meetings can be challenging explains Bowes, Matador’s Project Manager.


“When we tried towards the end of last year to do some Zoom meetings, obviously with the COVID restrictions it wasn’t possible to get a group of people together into the community halls,” says Bowes. “We’re not as advanced with our stakeholder negotiations as perhaps we would have liked to have been. So I think we still need to do quite a bit of work on that this year.”


Matador is hoping to get more feedback from communities on what their concerns are surrounding the project. While some individuals have come forward to discuss issues, such as potential impact to ground water or wildlife, they have yet to hear from community groups.


They have been working with indigenous groups and government bodies. Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) paid a site visit in 2019, as have other inspectors, to ensure environmental safety compliance regulations are being met.


“People do quite often reference Hope Brook, the mine that had issues previously, and ask questions around how we’re going to make sure we don’t have the same issues that Hope Brook had, and we’re going to look into that in a bit more detail. And we think we understand what issues they had and how we’re going to manage it,” says Bowes.


Working in partnership with local groups and businesses is key. Potma says Matador effectively vacated a specific area for about four weeks last year so as not to disrupt a local outfitter.


“We have the potential to impact that income for them,” says Potma. “So we literally packed up and moved out.”


He says that the company’s activities are designed to be low impact. The drill rigs are unlikely to be heard or even spotted after about a kilometre away from where they are working.


“We’re really cognizant of creating as little impact on the local communities as possible, and we try to do our drilling work before the hunting season starts,” notes Potma.


The advantage to having a milder than usual winter, in this region at least, is that it allows Matador to get on the ground much earlier than they normally would. Thanks to the pandemic, work in 2020 didn’t effectively get underway until July. It also helps that the Southwest Coast has escaped relatively unscathed.


“Australia has been very successful at containing it,” says Bowes. “We haven’t been in any lockdowns and we’ve had no community cases for nine months.”


He jokes that if he could somehow travel directly from Perth to the Southwest Coast, it would be perfect.


Getting up and running by mid-March means the weather will have to continue to co-operate as well. Any large accumulation of snow will force a delay, but so far everything is on track.


“There should be no trouble towards the end of March getting in there and doing all of the prep work for the drilling. The drilling will start a little bit later, but the surface work hopefully start March-April,” says Potma. “We’re really keen to get started as soon as we can.”",

      subtitles: "Former Deputy Mayor Aneitha Sheaves when she served with former Port aux Basques Mayor Brian Button.",
      body: "Aneitha Sheaves taught Brian Button a few important things during his tenure on Port aux Basques Town Council.  Button did not hesitate to share his memories about his time spent on council working with the former Mayor, who passed away on Friday, Jan. 8, at the age of 86.


“It wasn’t until I got elected with Mrs. Sheaves that I really found out how to conduct yourself to be a councillor, how to be a leader.”


Button was elected as Deputy Mayor under Mayor Sheaves in 1993. Aneitha had served as Deputy Mayor herself prior to that, but this was her first term serving as Mayor.


“When I got elected, Mrs. Sheaves, she called me and really set the tone right there, saying ‘Not to worry, and don’t be intimidated by the fact that you’re new and young,” recalls Button. “And from that I just felt I had someone there who I was going to learn from.”


Button held Mayor Sheaves in high regard and had a lot of respect for her. Of special note, says Button, is the way she conducted the Town meetings, and how she could make her point just by taking her time to explain it out. 


“She didn’t come at you like a raging bull, she would just explain, ’This is what the reality of it is’, and I had a lot of respect for her because of that.”


Sheaves ran a tight ship as Mayor, recalls Button.


“One thing, if the Council meeting started at 7:00, you’d better be ready to start at 7:00,” recalls Button. “It wasn’t like we would all stroll in at any time. We all knew that at our Council meetings we would all be there early, ready to go and be prepared because she was starting on time.”


When issues got time consuming and the banter became repetitive, Sheaves would put a stop to it, but only if no progress was being made. If a longer discussion was warranted, then Council would remain in session as long as necessary to sort it out.


“She just controlled the (mayor’s) chair very well and elegantly.”


In fact, during one of their trips as part of their Council duties, Button mentioned to Sheaves how he suspected she was setting him up.


“You make it seem like we’re Good Cop, Bad Cop. I’ll just go in and get it all riled up and you just come in and calm the water. She laughed.”


It’s still easy to see Mayor Sheaves’ legacy around town. A prime example is the Bruce II Sports Centre. The original Bruce Arena was destroyed by an electrical fire on Sept. 24, 1995, and Sheaves was determined that any replacement facility would be a substantial upgrade that could serve the entire region.


The cost involved was a hard sell even among her own councilors, recalls Button, who credits her with the necessary foresight to convince others to come on board.


“It will be worth the subsidizing, I remember her saying in budgets,” shared Button. “She was quick to recognize that the overall percentage of our budget, from 10 to 12 to 15 percent of our budget, is always spent in recreation, and a community deserves to have a healthy community and have a recreational facility available to them.”


Button believes that determination may have been gained, at least in part, from her experience as an entrepreneur as Mrs. Sheaves helped build the family’s construction company.


“She ran a business. She knew how a community runs a lot like a business but can’t be run entirely like a business,” he observed.


The Bruce II is not the only tangible part of Mayor Sheaves’ legacy. Thanks to her time, effort and relentless determination, the Dr. Charles L. LeGrow Health Centre has its own dialysis unit.


“That was something that was a real pet peeve of hers, that people were having to travel from here and from the coastal communities,” says Button. While others around the region played a part, “She was the one that led the charge.”


As the first and only female Mayor, Sheaves offers a lasting impact on other women.

“She continued on to make sure that women’s rights were heard, and she was an advocate for that,” said Button. “She opened the door for a lot of women.”


He recalls attending a convention with Mrs. Sheaves and watched a young delegate from another town approach their table.


“She leaned over and she said to Mrs. Sheaves, ‘I wanted to come over and meet you’,” recounts Button. “‘It was because of you, and seeing you and what you said that got me running for council.’”


Button’s tenure as Deputy Mayor under Sheaves was a major factor in his realization that he, too, could run for Mayor. The mentorship she had offered meant he was well prepared. 


“The reason I had that confidence is because I didn’t learn from books, I learned from her. It was Mrs. Sheaves that taught me about municipal politics, and politics in general, and really, how to conduct yourself.”


Button says he was proud to sit in the mayors chair after Mayor Sheaves, feeling like a student following the teacher. 


“I wore the chain (of office) after her, and I know on election night, Mrs. Sheaves was there congratulating me and I thought, ‘My God, I had one of the greatest people who taught me how to get here.’”


After he served his first term as Mayor, Button recalls a phone call he got from Mrs. Sheaves. She was informing him of her intent to run for Council. Unsure if she intended to run for Mayor again, he immediately began to question whether he had let her down. 


“Was she disappointed in the job I had done over the last four years?”


But Mrs. Sheaves had no intention of usurping his spot, she wanted to go back on the Town Council. 


“She recognized that she couldn’t go out and be on the go as much as the Mayor was, but she still had a lot to offer.”


As it happened, Mrs. Sheaves ended up becoming the Deputy Mayor, meaning the two had switched roles. Sheaves and Button served eight years together on council.


Button says the Town was lucky to have had her for a number of reasons, explaining that her love for Port aux Basques was second to none, which was always reflected in the passion of her speeches or presentations. 


Known by everyone, she was held in the highest regard by her municipal colleagues wherever she went, and Button recalls that even after she had left politics people always stopped him to check on her.


“How’s the former Mayor doing, how’s Mrs. Sheaves, what’s she up to?’ It was always how they greeted me, for a long time,” smiled Button at the recollection.


“Even after she passed, we got letters and calls from all over the province, saying how sorry they were to hear of her passing, and it just goes to show you, she was something else.”",

      subtitles: "Scott Reid is the Liberal incumbent seeking re-election in the riding of St. George’s-Humber.",
      body: "SOUTHWEST COAST – Scott Reid’s Bluetooth signal is cutting in and out as he drives from Stephenville to the Codroy Valley on Wednesday morning, Jan. 27. The cell service, or rather lack thereof, is one of those things he’d like to fix if he’s successfully elected for a fourth term.


“I’ve got a house in Stephenville and I’ve got a place that I share with my father in the Codroy Valley,” said Reid.


Reid likes to maintain close ties to the Codroy Valley. He credits the area’s support for helping him win the Liberal nomination after Joan Burt stepped down, triggering a 2014 by-election. 


“This will be my fourth election in less than seven years,” noted Reid. “I was around politics before I ran myself and I guess I knew what I was getting into when I decided to run.”


Reid is no stranger to campaigning, although with the COVID-19 restrictions in place, he’s still having to adjust his approach. He’s always been accessible on social media, but lately he’s upped that presence, and even taken to cold calling constituents and mail outs inviting them to contact him directly. He says that he’s responding as quickly as he can to messages and e-mails.


“I’ve been doing some door-to-door. I was sort of hesitant as to whether I would do any door-to-door this time and I know people are cautious,” said Reid. “In Newfoundland we’ve been good, but still there are precautions you have to take if you’re doing door-to-door.’


Like other candidates trying the in-person approach, Reid adheres to pandemic protocols by wearing a mask, dropping literature and staying outside at an appropriate distance.

Cell service problems aside, Reid has a lengthy To Do list for the riding of St. George’s - Humber.


“It’s a combination of maintaining services we have, improving services we have, and also having a long-term vision – improving the economy of the area and adapting to the changing needs of the district.”


The biggest need that he has identified is the poor road condition, which he considers to be a safety hazard as much as an inconvenience.


“I would say they’re the biggest issue that I’m up against there in the district because it’s something that impacts everyone traveling around within the Valley,” observed Reid. “To be quite frank, they’re in atrocious condition.”


Reid says that improving them for residents, employers like the fish plant and larger agricultural producers is important. To show the potential benefits instead of just the necessity of these repairs, he is looking at tying in tourism access and even enticing more residents to the area.


“People I think will come back and relocate back to the Valley for a lifestyle,” said Reid.


In particular, he wants to target a demographic he calls “silver entrepreneurs” who are looking for that lifestyle. They aren’t quite ready to retire but are seeking to change their lifestyle and might want to keep a hobby farm. Reid believes the Valley would be a perfect fit, but enticing more permanent residents to increase the tax base requires better maintenance of basic infrastructure.


Reid seems to spot opportunities practically everywhere. One of the most obvious is in agriculture.


“We don’t grow a lot of the food that we eat in this province,” said Reid. “I’m encouraged by some of the things I’m seeing.”


He mentions a 26-acre potato farm in South Branch, and another farm in Bay St. George as examples of successful smaller scale producers.


“We’ve seen changes in the way that people buy their food. It used to be that people bought their food at small stores,” he said.


But large grocery store chains require a guaranteed supply, and that can be tricky for smaller farms. 


“I think we have to work with the producers to either co-operate or grow to a level where they can compete with the producers in PEI, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia,” said Reid.


Others might do better by setting up a farmers market or even erect a kiosk on their property, perhaps adjacent to the main road, so that consumers can buy fresh produce and proteins directly from the producer.


“I think there are opportunities for agriculture in the Codroy Valley and I want to work with people to develop that.”


Reid said that there’s already multiple federal and provincial funding available for agricultural growth, even for smaller producers.


“There’s a lot of funding for those who want to start agricultural enterprises. There’s funding for equipment, there’s funding for people who want to clear land, stuff like that,” noted Reid. “If anyone is interested, I’m certainly willing to work with them and help them out and help them navigate the funding opportunities that are there.”


When it comes to tourism, Reid is quick to point out the Coastangs Trail. Developing the trail network and other opportunities will, by extension, necessitate better roads.


“When I talk to people in government, they talk about things like destination trails, where you have a product that’s so good that people will travel from around the world to come and hike these trails, they’re so good,” said Reid. “Sometimes people are a little upset that all of these funds aren’t going towards roads, but I think we have to have a balanced approach. One sort of aids the other. If you have these other economic things happening, they’ll demonstrate a need for other services in the area.”


Reid said that the government funded a study into the potential for trail development. It found trails in the Codroy Valley were comparable to the world-renowned trails in Gros Morne.


“There are opportunities to attract people from Gros Morne down our way,” said Reid, “As well as local people to have opportunities to hike these trails as well.”


Helping existing businesses continue to grow is another part of his long-term plan. Reid pointed to fish plant owner John Osmond as a prime example, stating that Osmond is “very innovative in the work”. Reid believes that kind of approach benefits the entire Southwest Coast, not just the Valley.


Something else that could benefit the entire region is affordable housing, particularly for seniors. Funding already exists there too.


“I think there is probably a need for seniors accommodations in the Codroy Valley, and I think there’s an opportunity there for a private sector or a government assisted sort of living,” said Reid.


Pulling these pieces together like a kind of jigsaw puzzle is going to take time, and like residents around the district Reid gets frustrated too. Still, he promises to chip away at it as best he can.


There was some road work done last summer, and he is the first to concede that there’s still much more to be done. But to do it requires a specific vision, and Reid clearly has one.

“We have to think about how we can solve our problems in innovative ways.”",

      subtitles: "Andrew Parsons is the Liberal incumbent seeking re-election in the riding of Burgeo-La Poile.",
      body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Andrew Parsons finds that more of his constituents tend to reach out during an election campaign. He’d spent much of the day campaigning in Rose Blanche-Harbour Le Cou, dropping off pamphlets and chit chatting, socially distanced of course, with those he met along the way. 


“When people see you more, I think it tends to remind them that you’re there,” offers Parsons via telephone interview on Tuesday evening, Jan. 26.


He has solid experience with campaigning, so he isn’t finding COVID-19 to be much of a hindrance.


“It’s been a different campaign, but overall I think people seem to get it and to appreciate it,” he says.


As the incumbent seeking a fourth term, Parsons says it’s a bit easier as constituents are already well aware of who he is and what he brings to the table.


“I’ve had a decade to get to know people, to talk to people, so it’s not the getting to know you factor anymore,” notes Parsons. “I’ve been talking to some of my colleagues who are running for the first time, and so they’re coming up to the door with a hat on a face mask on, all the protocols, and so people don’t know if you’re a volunteer or the person. Recognition is harder.”


Parsons enjoys public service and helping people resolve issues. He and his “right hand”, Joanne Clarke, have only just helped a local resident arrange necessary medical transportation.


“This is something that was obviously urgent to them,” he notes. “It’s not like it’s something where you just make a call and it’s done. You have to call, you have to advocate, you have to e-mail, you have to argue the points and at the end of the day we got a positive resolution, and that gives you that feeling that you need.”


Although an election has been called, Parsons still serves as MHA for Burgeo-LaPoile, Attorney General and Minister of Industry, Energy and Technology (IET). It’s a lot to juggle, but he says he always puts his riding first.


“A long-term politician once told me, ‘Don’t ever forget where you’re from,’” shares Parsons. “It’s no different than any profession. You get better at it.”


Parsons is not a fan of campaigns, even as he enjoys meeting voters. He says proving his worth to represent the riding is found in the work he does in between elections, not knocking on doors.


“I think people have a perception that you show up and campaign and then you go into hibernation. It’s the opposite, if anything.”


Parsons quickly lists the more pressing issues within the riding, most of which he’s been chipping away at for years.


“Today a lot of people worry about Muskrat Falls and the price of electricity. That’s sort of an evergreen one,” he says. “That’s obviously a provincial-wide issue. Healthcare is an issue. Everybody worries about that, and then you have your specific local issues, which is access to healthcare.”


One of the bigger issues also revolves around the spotty or non-existent cell service coverage along the Southwest Coast. Parsons has been working on that one for years and, in conjunction with Bell and the provincial government, attempted to kickstart a program to improve coverage and is still working to tweak it.


“It’s still an issue in certain areas. Roads, road work, transportation – we have to drive to get anywhere so roads are always a perpetual issue for people.”


Another perpetual issue is employment. It’s not his department, but Parsons shares that the cold live-storage feasibility study is underway now that the hiring has been done.


“I’m pretty happy about it. I think it’s a no-brainer,” says Parsons. “It makes all the sense in the world, especially in this location, when it comes to getting our product out of province via the biggest conveyance of traffic.”


He’s also been working with Matador Mining, who continue to develop the Cape Ray Gold Mining Project. Parsons shares that he spoke with them as recently as last week.


“We’ve been working with them to help with trying to get their people into the province to do the job,” says Parsons, before noting, “It’s all ultimately up to the Chief Medical Officer of the province. They are the ultimate decision maker.”


Both of these ventures represent much-needed jobs for the Southwest Coast, but Parson’s role is limited mostly to providing information and guidance through the application process necessary to re-enter the province or acquiring necessary permits. He’s quick to point out that the Chief Medical Officer is not open to lobbying on the company’s behalf.


“My job is just to work with them to present the case, but at the end of the day I can’t make up medical evidence. These businesses have to come up with the plan, the safeguards, and get the sign off from the Chief Medical Officer.”


Regardless of outcome, he makes it a priority to keep abreast of what changes are going on in the district and promotes it wherever and whenever he can. He’ll also work to help employers outside of district too, because that means more jobs and more money. He has worked hard to establish a relationship with the producers of the TV show Hudson & Rex.


“People don’t realize the hundreds of thousands of dollars that a TV production brings into this province,” he says. “Matador needs to get on the ground to push forward their development, and that’s going to lead to local jobs. It’s going to lead to business spin offs. It’s going to lead to, for the province, business tax.”


He’s got other projects he’s continuing to work on also, like aquaculture developments near Burgeo. In his role as Minister of IET, he’s also exploring clean energy development. There are also rare issues he tackles, ones he hardly hears about outside of an election campaign. He mentions wood cutting permits as one such example.


“Everything is within the context of COVID, so this is the most unusual election,” he says. “But I also think that’s one of our strengths.”


Parsons compares Newfoundland’s success in flattening the curve to other provinces, or even the rest of the world. He’s not willing to credit solely the geography for that success either, but instead points to residents, leadership and the provincial health department for their work in keeping the pandemic under control.


Parsons believes that continuing to follow guidelines will mean businesses can get back to normal sooner, and that in turn helps the provincial economy kickstart back up much sooner than in places where COVID-19 continues to thrive. Businesses mean tax revenues and that pays for provincial social services. Without that, he says, the whole thing falls apart.


“I think it’s been a pretty safe job done here, a pretty good job,” says Parsons. “You could have the best leadership, but the people, the province, have really chosen to protect each other, to worry about each other.”",

      subtitles: "Shane Snook is the NL Alliance candidate for the riding of St. George’s-Humber.",
      body: "FLAT BAY – Shane Snook is a self-described jack of all trades. He’s spent time in the military and has worked out West, but eventually the lifestyle he sought brought him back to Newfoundland.


“At the end of the day it was not the right place for me. The whole rat race is not my style,” said Snook via phone interview on Thursday, Jan. 28. “This is home, right, and a little bit simpler is a little bit better for me personally.”


Snook is blunt about dipping his toe into the political waters.


“I got into politics because I hate politics, as ironic as that sounds,” he laughs. “The political climate in Newfoundland is really toxic – or even in Canada in general really – and it really shouldn’t be that way.”


Snook says that toxicity is why the younger generations, those in their 20s and 30s, are checking out. He’s hoping that he and other candidates running under the NL Alliance banner can help provide a viable alternative to the partisan political landscape.


“We need to focus on the things that are important and just do things the proper way, so to speak.”


Lacking political experience is not necessarily a hindrance explains Snook. He’s well aware of the province’s bigger issues and knows firsthand how they affect individuals.


“There’s always going to be the big ticket items that are front and centre, something like COVID or Muskrat Falls,” he says. “What’s important and fundamental for me is the electoral reform that we’re so overdue for, which is part of the reason I ended up gravitating towards the NL Alliance.”


Formed in 2018, the NL Alliance describes itself as less of a political party and more of a group of like-minded individuals who want to change the political system itself.


“The party system, the partisanship, is a really dysfunctional system, and we’re seeing those adverse effects pile up over time,” says Snook. “I think we need to move away from the party system into something a bit more welcoming – a consensus party, for example.”


Under a consensus party, elected candidates would each have a say in policy and would represent their riding’s interest to the government, instead of representing government policy to the public, explains Snook.


“We’ve got it backwards right now. That’s not the greatest road.”


Snook has been reaching out to voters and the issues remain the same now as they did when he ran in the last provincial election – roads, healthcare and cellular service. All three, he points out, have a direct bearing on public safety and quality of life.


Snook cites a report he saw a few years ago that found road work priority lists were not being followed by the provincial contractors. The 2017 report by Newfoundland and Labrador’s Auditor General Terry Paddon, which is available online, took issue with all stages of roadwork management by the province, including how the roads are prioritized for repairs and how the aging demographic is affected.


“That’s the kind of thing that needs to be addressed to make sure that the road conditions are usable right across the board and they’re made to last,” says Snook. “Current day, it’s hard not to joke about how when you drive from the West Coast across to St. John’s you can tell how far you are by how the roads improve as you go.”


Healthcare is another long-standing concern. He says it’s not necessarily just about improving access, but expanding support for the practices that are already working well.


“I have to admit the nurse-practitioner system seems to be going very well,” offers Snook. 


When it comes to cell service, Snook believes the number of areas that lack a signal is a safety hazard. Other issues more specific to the riding are things he has to learn about, but he is eager to do just that.


“I have to acknowledge that I don’t know everything and I can’t know everything, but when people do come forward with issues, then it would be my responsibility to actually bring those issues to the table,” says Snook. “It’s important to listen to that feedback.”


Larger issues, like COVID-19, have revealed how vulnerable this province actually is when it comes to self-sustainability, says Snook.


“If the boats shut down and things stop getting imported, that trade route so to speak, that could be a huge problem for us.”


Becoming more self-sustaining through small scale agricultural initiatives will reduce that vulnerability while also helping to re-start and grow the economy. Snook is a huge fan of the homesteading lifestyle, though he acknowledges it’s not as simple as it used to be.


Keeping livestock and sowing fields means unavoidable overhead costs. But by helping to reduce those costs as opposed to handing out loans and grants, Snook believes more people can enjoy that kind of lifestyle while helping to solve a province-wide problem.


“I like to think that goes hand in hand with a lot of the economic things,” says Snook. “Even just the trade deficit that comes with importing all of our foods, because in my mind, imported goods and services are exported dollars.”


There are lots of issues, and Snook readily admits there aren’t simple, easy answers to the more complex problems. He believes that will require people to come together instead of relying on government to fix things, and that’s what the NL Alliance is focused on.


“It’s not quite a party in the sense that we’re all so accustomed to, so it makes some of the conversations a bit challenging, because it doesn’t really fit the mould we’re accustomed to,” says Snook. “Yesterday I was asked about ‘What would your party promise about such and such a thing?’ That’s not the approach we’re taking. It’s not about the party. It’s about the individual and his or her district.”


He knows the NL Alliance is fighting an uphill battle when it comes to political reform, but he’s committed to doing just that.

NHL Noise

Last weekend, the Winnipeg Jets and the Columbus Blue Jackets pulled off a blockbuster trade. Pierre-Luc Dubois wanted out of Columbus, and the situation deteriorated quicker than a Trump hairdo in a Wreckhouse windstorm.


Following a game where Dubois mailed it in and the coach nailed him to the bench, GM Jarmo Kekäläinen decided it was time to pull the trigger.  Hockey Insider Darren Dreger reported that 20+ teams expressed interest in Dubois.


In Winnipeg, GM Kevin Chevaldayoff had his own unhappy camper. Patrik Laine, in the last year of his contract, preferred to move on from the Jets.


A player swap seemed logical, except Columbus desperately needed a centre in the deal. So Chevy dipped into his bag of Les Misérables and hauled out Columbus native Jack Roslovic, a young centre and unsigned restricted free agent.  


Laine and Roslovic for Dubois and a 3rd round pick. Done deal.  The Jets now have one of the league’s best 1-2 punches down the middle in Mark Scheifele and Dubois. But they paid dearly to get it.


Meanwhile, the Blue Jackets are laughing at landing one of the NHL’s elite goal scorers, but at centre, significant question marks remain. 


So who won the deal? We may have to wait a bit to see who asks to be traded first.

Elsewhere in the NHL, on Wednesday, Jan. 27, the Pittsburgh Penguins announced GM Jim Rutherford had resigned for personal reasons. Rutherford has three Stanley Cups, two earned since joining the Pens in 2014. The veteran GM has been widely criticized, but he was brought in with a mandate – win in Sid and Geno’s window. 


Referred to as Brass Balls Rutherford by exactly no one but me, he was famously “all in” and fearlessly traded away assets to build around Crosby and Malkin. You can poke holes in specific deals, but it’s hard to penetrate those Cups.  


Another storyline I’m watching is the race for the Calder Trophy, awarded to the NHL’s rookie of the year. At least six players are worth some attention. Let’s start with the top picks of the 2020 NHL Entry Draft.


Drafted 1st overall by the New York Rangers, Alexis Lafrenière was scoreless in his first six games. Number 2 pick Quinton Byfield is out with an injury after being assigned to the AHL but is expected to see action with the Los Angeles Kings this season. Tim Stützle, the 3rd pick, was also sidelined by injury, but in three games with the Ottawa Senators has one goal. 

Amongst Canadian teams, keep an eye on three more kids.


Ville Heinola, drafted 20th in 2019 by Winnipeg, was scoreless after seeing action in one game. Nick Robertson, selected at 53 by Toronto in 2019, was held pointless in one game before being injured. In Montreal, Alexander Romanov has one goal and one assist in six games for the Habs. He was the 38th pick in the 2018 draft.


Raptors Racket

The stairs that get you out of the basement are never as fun as the ones that get you to the penthouse, but the Toronto Raptors are climbing back to .500 after a nice run of six wins in eight games. They started the season with two noticeable holes – size in their forward group and depth off the bench.


When Pascal Siakam went down last week to injury, Coach Nurse turned to Stanley Johnson to join the starting line up and that decision was rewarded. Johnson was a factor in the win and made a case to carry a bigger load from the bench.

The Raptors are banged up and time is running out for them to move up the standings before trade deadline.


Blue Jays Babble

The Toronto Blue Jays dipped into the free agent market again this week. Marcus Semien has joined the Jays on a one-year $18-million deal.


Semien has been in the majors for eight years, spending the last six seasons with the Oakland Athletics. He has primarily played shortstop but is expected to move to second base in Toronto, with Bo Bichette secure at short.


As of press deadline, the Blue Jays have committed more than $180 million to free agents, strengthening the outfield, infield and pitching depth. The Jays might be spending like a drunken sailor, but the moves might not be enough unless they can bolster their pitching options.  


Pitching you say?


On Wednesday night the Jays traded three prospects to the Mets for lefty Steven Matz.

Matz is not the ace fans may have hoped for, and the Jays may not be done. They’re hoping pitching coach Pete Walker can help Matz compete for a spot in their starting rotation.


Superbowl Squawks

The stage has been set for the final game of the NFL season. Super Bowl LV will take place at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa on Sunday, Feb. 7, 2021. 


Patrick Mahomes cleared concussion protocol in time to lead the Kansas City Chiefs to a 38-24 rout over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship game.


In the NFC, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Green Bay Packers to the tune of 31-26, and Tom Brady is going to the Super Bowl without Bill Belichick.


It’s probably poor form to say so in a sports column, but my favourite part of the Super Bowl is the food.


Let me introduce you to Valerie Bertinelli’s Potato Skins with Beer Cheese. Easy, delicious, and you can find them in the Google machine.

Such increases once again smack of a total disregard for the concerns expressed by the people of Newfoundland and Labrador on the out of reach costs associated with our constitutionally guaranteed essential equivalent of the Trans Canada Highway, and smacks of a total disregard for Prime Minister Trudeau's 2015 campaign promise to examine Ottawa's high cost recovery formula on the service and return affordability to what is a provincial lifeline. 


The people of Newfoundland and Labrador will now look for costs related to essential pharmacy items, propane, wood, groceries and overall deliveries of nearly every possible item to increase as these new rate are passed along to consumers. 


Effective April 1, the following changes Marine Atlantic's rate structure will take place:  No increases to passenger fares or passenger vehicle fares on the Gulf route but passenger and vehicle fares will increase by 2.5% on the Argentia route. Commercial fares will increase by 2% (Gulf and Argentia). The drop trailer management fee will increase by 3.4%.


When will the bleeding stop?

      body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – On a mild winter weekend, Jan. 16 and 17, the Port aux Basques chapter of the Sou’ Wes NFLD Delta Waterfowl association hosted a firearms training session for youth. The cost of the course was covered by Delta Waterfowl at a relatively low cost of $750 and was held at the College of the North Atlantic (CNA) campus in Port aux Basques.


Chair Mark Lomond said that he believes in teaching kids gun safety at a young age.


“They soaked up everything and I think the earlier you teach them the better.”


In accordance with provincial COVID-19 regulations, the class was restricted to a maximum of 10 participants. Students followed all of the CNA and provincial pandemic protocols.


“We sponsored the course as a way to invest back into the community. Whether they hunt or not, they will have knowledge of firearms and safe handling,” said Lomond.


Lomond places high importance of firearms safety.


“For the sake of our heritage, the Sou’wes Delta Waterfowl is a big supporter of recruiting new waterfowlers and passing along traditional hunting practices. Completing the hunter safety course is the first big step to being a part of this long standing Newfoundland tradition.”


Lomond explained, “Over the duration of the course, which took two days, the participants learned about firearms, safe operation and handling, survival skills, compasses/navigation, hunter ethics, history of hunting in our area, and more.”


Among the students participating in the course was Cohen Cook. At 11 years old, Cohen is still too young to legally hunt, but that didn’t prevent him from becoming the youngest person in Newfoundland and Labrador to ever complete the firearms safety course successfully. 


Greg Cook, Cohen’s father, said that he had some reservations initially, but after seeing a Facebook post asking for photos of young hunters, Greg submitted a photo of his son. 


“I thought he was too young, because it started at 12 years old, and he's only 11,” said Greg. 


After learning that the firearms safety course was being offered to interested youths, Greg gave the go ahead.


“I asked if Cohen could do the course, and they looked into it, and said yeah he can.”


Cohen wanted to do the course “because I really like to go hunting with my Dad, and do other stuff, like out and around.”


He said the best part was just “knowing that I passed.”


“He did it all on his own,” said his father. “I’m very proud of him.”


Cohen plans to go hunting for moose with his father next year, and a rather big smile crept over his face when the idea of bird hunting was brought up as well.


“Ducks, maybe some Turrs,” are apparently also on his list.


But the main reason he loves to go hunting has nothing to do with the actual harvest. It boils down to something we all relate to, especially given the ongoing pandemic restrictions.


“Spending time with family that I barely get to see,” said Cohen.


Along with other groups, Delta Waterfowl pushed to have the minimum age limit for youth hunter training lowered, and in 2017 it was announced that it would be lowered to 16 for big game and down to 12 for small game. That means as of next year, Cohen and his father can spend all the time they want together in the woods.  


Sou’wes Delta Waterfowl wants to train more youths like Cohen.


“It was a great success and the local chapter hopes to sponsor a class of youth annually from now on,” said Lomond.",

      body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Town council and then-MHA Andrew Parsons expressed a sense of loss and frustration when the affordable housing project was canceled in Aug. 2020. The proposed construction of eight mobility-friendly units was sorely needed, and over 30 people had submitted their names hoping to secure a unit. However the project never really got far off the ground, primarily due to a lack of funding.


Since Port aux Basques was dealing with massive revenue losses, thanks in large part to the COVID-19 pandemic that had derailed tourism draws like Come Home Year, it could not afford to take out a loan to make up the difference.


“It would place a financial burden on the taxpayers,” said Coun. Melvin Keeping at the time.

Keeping, who is on the board of the Gateway Village Corporation that undertook the affordable housing initiative, had run for council in large part to see the project come to fruition.


But even as the project was canceled, the town and Parsons pledged to learn from the experience and explore future funding initiatives. It appears their efforts have been successful. Town Manager Leon MacIsaac has confirmed that the affordable housing initiative is underway one again.


“Gateway Village Corporation has approval to receive approximately $1.6 million dollars to build 8 accessible and energy efficient units subject to meeting a number of design and financial criteria,” wrote MacIsaac via e-mail.


The necessary criteria is set forth by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and the Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corporation (NLHC). MacIsaac clarified that the funding was obtained through separate CMHC programs for affordable housing.


Responding to inquiries, MacIsaac wrote, “There is still one affordable housing project that is slated for the Stadium Road area; however, alternate sites have been reviewed as well.”


Stadium Road is the site of the Bruce Arena, which burned to the ground in 1995. The concrete platform that remains has been vacant ever since, but offers a stunning view of the town and harbour and has already undergone environmental assessment during the first attempt to build affordable housing units at that site. 


MacIsaac believes that the funding should prove sufficient to see the project through to completion this time around.


“Both the previous and current funding streams will provide sufficient funds, however, changes in labour and material costs will affect the overall budget.”


Gateway Village Corporation intends to start the project this spring, after receiving final approval.


“Further environmental studies have to be completed prior to receiving approvals and can take a number of weeks depending on availability of consultants,” explained the town manager.


All construction on the affordable housing units must be completed by March 2022.",

      body: "CODROY VALLEY – “I’m not a closet player, but a volunteer player in a little band. I’m by no means a professional musician,” says Dion Devoe. 


His musical talents say otherwise. Mainly focusing on guitar, he also plays keyboard, accordion, “a few other instruments” and sings as well. 


Devoe hails from the Codroy Valley, although he seems to prefer just saying he’s from the Southwest Coast. It's almost as though he doesn’t want to shoehorn himself into any single category. 


Indeed, with his hand in so many pots, that isn’t something that is easily done regardless. Devoe has been teaching one of the most popular courses at College of the North Atlantic (Port aux Basques Campus) for the past 13 years, runs a guest cottage rental business with his wife, Claudelle, is a hobby farmer and gardener who raises chickens, and is the co-chair of the Codroy Valley Folk Festival. 


Since that’s apparently not enough to keep him busy, he’s also a member of the The Breeze Band. The band is about 10 years old and addition to Devoe consists of Gordon Cormier, “Hockey” Gale, and Walter Devoe. 


Devoe’s love and passion for music is evident in the affection with which he discusses the region’s rich musical history and talents.


“Like most of us Newfoundlanders, I think music is a big part of our culture, a big part of our life,” he says, “Music was our entertainment. So I grew up – being 4 or 5 years old – and hearing my uncle, Walter, part of the band. He was a big influence. My Dad played the accordion, my grandfather sang and played the accordion. I’ve got music on my Mom’s side.”


He recalls his very first foray into playing an instrument.


“So yeah, I started playing the spoons when I was six. Walter gave me my first set of spoons. I played the accordion, cause Dad played the accordion. I played the keyboard as a young fella, 10 or 11 years old, and I got my first guitar when I was 14.”


Devoe prefers the guitar, and says he enjoys the traditional “picking tunes” and country music, such as Merle Haggard or George Jones. 


Once he got fairly comfortable playing in front of people, Devoe began to play at weddings.

“That’s basically where I cut my teeth I guess.”


Devoe hasn’t been able to play in front of a live audience thanks to COVID-19. These days he is limited to mostly jamming in the basement, but did let slip that he and Walter are working on a CD. 


“My uncle is working on a traditional accordion tune album, and we’ve been working on that for a while, over COVID basically.”


Devoe has no plans to host any Zoom concerts or online Facebook live streams to share his music, but he also hasn’t closed the door entirely on the idea.


“I’ve thought about it, maybe doing it myself, but only so many people like to sit down and listen to two hours of Smiley Bates and Conway,” says Devoe.

      subtitles: "Something must be done about the old municipal garage downtown, but what? - © FILE PHOTO",
      body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Even though the town has relocated its equipment to the new municipal garage in Grand Bay West, there is still a lot of work to be done at the old location. Sitting across from Town Hall on Main Street, the old depot is no longer actively in use, but there are questions about what to do with it.  Council has discussed the matter during its last two council meetings, held on Jan. 13 and Feb. 2. 


In the January meeting, Coun. Jim Lane observed that there are numerous materials and equipment that could be easily put to use in other facilities. He believes that the Channel-Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department might be able to re-purpose some of the structure to use for constructing its new smoke house training facility. 


However, prior to anything being done, the entire lot must undergo thorough testing to determine what, if any, environmental impact that 42 years of use may have had.  Since 1978, the lot has been used as a fuel station, a salt facility, vehicle storage and more. Over the years, it’s almost a certainty that contaminants have leached into the soils below. 


The Town intends to have a study done through a partnership with Grenfell College and Memorial University. The study will be able to assess the levels of petroleum and heavy metal contaminants that may have leached into the soil. Ultimately, the goal is to turn the area into a green space, which means the ground must be free of these contaminants and there is no chance it will leach into the groundwater. 


Bulk soil samples will be collected from various spots on the site, and then those samples will be sent for laboratory testing to determine the exact contents. The study will also determine the feasibility of compost, earthworms and grass for the bio-remediation of the soil. The results of the experimentation will be used to design a pilot project for the site. 


“The main goal of the research is to develop and test a sustainable green remediation technology to bring down the contaminant levels in a hydrocarbon and heavy metal contaminated site so that it can be used for public use,” said Mayor John Spencer during the Feb. meeting.


The project will use electromagnetic induction to determine the depth of contamination, and the types of chemicals that need to be dealt with. It is expected that beginning with taking samples, through to the testing, and up to the process of re-mediating the soil will take approximately two years. 


Town Manager Leon MacIsaac also told Council there exists the possibility that the old depot may simply be too contaminated for and public green space.


“They may come back and recommend that we ought to put a one meter cap over the existing grounds, and re-mediate it through plantation, and that would be the failsafe.”


Although the current council envisions the area as a green space for residents to enjoy, all they can do is offer recommendation and guidance said Spencer via e-mail.


“This will not be the mandate of the present Council given this is an election year. The new council elected in September will be charged with setting a strategy based on the work of previous Council. I remember discussions on a new municipal garage surfacing when I was first elected in 1993; 2020 marked the opening of this magnificent structure. Don’t really want to talk about taking that much time but we need to take our time to get it right,” noted Spencer via e-mail.",

      body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The Bruce II Sports Centre has been awarded 1.4 million dollars from the Climate Change Challenge Fund (CCCF) for energy efficiency and other upgrades. The announcement was made during January’s council meeting by Town Manager Leon MacIsaac.


The town worked with six other municipalities in partnership with the Canadian Federation of Municipalities to access this climate change funding for the sports centre. An additional $140,000 was awarded for upgrades to the Port aux Basques central fire station.


The town has also received a further $500,000 for upgrades to the sports facility’s Dectron unit, which is designed to control humidity in a pool area. That means just under two million dollars worth of investment in total for the building, which is now 25 years old and in need of upgrades.


“Through these programs, town staff can receive training regarding climate science, greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, climate change adaption, and participate in collaborative workshops,” said MacIsaac, reading aloud from the announcement letter.


The are four milestone targets to hit and town has already completed Phase 1 and 2 of the plan, and Phase 3 is underway. Phase 4 deals with future action plans, explained MacIsaac.


“Through the different project categories we’ve identified the Bruce II Sports Centre for fuel switching and energy and efficiency, the central fire hall for fuel switching and energy and efficiency, the Grand Bay West garage depot roof refit, which we also recently received funding for from the province to the tune of about $150,000. We also looked at a residential energy and efficiency program, which council discussed,” said MacIsaac. “There’s currently a rat program. There are other coming initiatives.”


MacIsaac’s lengthy list of upcoming initiatives ran the gamut from car pooling to cost saving initiatives for the new waste water treatment plant.


“We’ll also take a look at coastal erosion and restoration throughout the projects,” noted MacIsaac.


For Phase 4 future plans, the town hopes to look at energy and efficiency upgrades to the Grand Bay fire hall and the old fish plant, particularly if the ongoing study determines Port aux Basques is a suitable location for a cold and live seafood storage facility.


Water conservation and composting programs were highlighted as possible future plans for residents, particularly when it comes to heating and insulation programs. Coun. Melvin Keeping asked if water metering was one of the conservation measures being discussed, and MacIsaac did concede that was a possible avenue to be explored, but cautioned that metering was very costly for the most part.


“A lot of these are just suggestions,” MacIsaac pointed out.


The town manager also touched upon how COVID-19 has revealed the need to address food security within our region.


“We’ll get food committees and workshops for area residents,” he said, before urging council to go through the documentation at their leisure. “There is some very real and relevant information in there.”


Mayor John Spencer was quick to point out that these changes were absolutely necessary moving forward.


“Our communities are going bankrupt. We are going to bankrupt these communities with the regressive taxation system we have now. Property tax is a regressive tax. You pay more tax because you do up your property,” said MacIsaac. “The funds to municipalities are being stretched to their limit.”


Spencer revealed that the town paid $8,700 last year to run the Train Museum, a building that he called “basically empty”. By comparison, the Town Office cost a little under $11,000 to operate. He also shared that the town pays $78,870 per year for its streetlights and he plans to reduce that cost by taking Newfoundland Power up on their offer.


“They said they’re going to give us as many of those LED lights as we can get. The quicker we can get those LED lights in, the better and smarter we will be, because we’re not getting new money from government,” said Spencer.


Spencer noted that the town’s tax base was shrinking and will only continue to shrink. He noted that the town of Appleton was forced to eliminate its senior discount because they could not longer afford to continue it.


In order to reduce operational costs for the water treatment plant and Bruce II, green energy options such as solar panels and wind power are being explored. It has yet to be determined what alternative will be installed at the Bruce II in place of its current oil and propane system. In evaluating cost savings measures, however, feasibility and durability must be taken into account, particularly when it comes to the potential impact of the area’s typically strong winds on green energy infrastructure.


“The CCCF consultants are currently gathering information to determine what areas and types of energy efficiency upgrades would best address the funding provided. Once that is completed, a formal tender can be prepared to source interested companies,” clarified MacIsaac via e-mail last week.


Once the upgrades to the Bruce II are completed, it is estimated that the town will see an annual cost savings of $170,000.


“We’ve going to have to find a way to get smart,” said Spencer.",

      body: "In 1977, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau established a Federal Commission of Inquiry with a goal to examine existing transportation services in Newfoundland and Labrador to determine whether they meet “generally accepted Canadian norms, and where appropriate, recommend changes to meet current and future needs.” 


Recommendation #80 read: In principle, the Gulf crossing should be treated as the equivalent of a road crossing, with rates for basic travel charged accordingly. 


The commission reiterated its view that, under the Terms of Union, the Federal government is responsible for assuming all public costs to services, stating as long as there is reasonable traffic offerings. And, as such, this obligation would likely be accepted in reference to the Supreme Court of Canada. 


Newfoundland’s nationhood was achieved through toil and sacrifice over generations struggling to carve out a life on the edge of the North Atlantic. Britain recognized this when it bestowed Dominion status after witnessing the heroic action of our young men, the Blue Puttees, at the Battle of Beaumont in 1916. That nationhood was surrendered in 1949 under the Terms of Union with Canada.


Those Terms of Union are now broken.


Ottawa has failed miserably on imposing a high cost recovery formula on goods and services transported on the Gulf ferries, forcing Marine Atlantic Inc., the service providers, to recover 65% of every dollar spent on the service. Because of high travel costs associated with the essential Gulf service, Newfoundlanders and Labradorians have lost the right under the Canadian Charter to travel freely and openly across this country without the undue burden of great cost. 


Cost recovery on the Gulf run was never the intent under the Terms of Union. The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador must challenge this breach in the Supreme Court of Canada.


Candidates for the Premier’s office in this election must include a court challenge as part of the mandate to fix a broken agreement. 


In 2001, an adult fare was $22.00. Today, the same fare is $44.78. Cost of Living for same period increased by 47%. Transport Canada’s approved rate increase is at 104%. Ottawa’s bleeding to meet cost-recovery targets must stop.  


This past November, the same concern was put to volunteer Chair of Newfoundland Economic Recovery team. To paraphrase: Dame Moya Greene’s answer went something like this....


“It is not unreasonable for us to see things have a cost. There has to be the expectation that someone has to pay.”


Yes. On that we can agree, but by paying through the nose on the backs of the people of Newfoundland and Labrador who, by necessity need the essential service, is not the answer.

      body: "Here’s what you need to know this week about the sports you love.


NHL Noise

The job satisfaction theme continued in the NHL with insider reports from TSN, Sportsnet and The Athletic. The Calgary Flames were in Montreal to play the Canadiens when news broke that Victor Mete and Sam Bennett – both represented by player agent Darren Ferris – were unhappy with their roles and were requesting a trade.


Each player’s situation is unique. Mete, a 4th round draft choice, was given much opportunity over three seasons with the Habs. Promoted early due to a poorly constructed defence group, Mete has seen plenty of ice. But as the Habs have improved, Mete has dropped like a sack of spuds through a wet paper bag.  


Bennett, on the other hand, was the 4th overall pick in 2014. Expectations for him were high, but he has not delivered. Bennett no doubt believes he has not been placed in a position to succeed, spending most of his time in the bottom six. Ferris took to the media to get his kids opportunity elsewhere. 


On Sunday morning the New York Rangers told Ferris to hold their beer. At noon they placed defenceman Tony DeAngelo on waivers, and rumours began to dribble out about the gong show in their dressing room, with DeAngelo at centre stage. 


The Rangers can’t feign surprise – DeAngelo was as mysterious as a bucket. His career, in junior and the NHL, is rife with suspensions for offences from harassing teammates to abusing officials. His social media presence can only be described as dark and twisty. Yet the Rangers gave him a hefty contract in October. DeAngelo cleared waivers on Monday. You’d think the line-up would be short for this level of tangly, but a trade is expected.  

On the ice, teams are figuring out their rosters having not had the benefit of pre-season games. Some squads have identified bigger holes than others. 


In Edmonton, the Oilers story is familiar – strong up front but struggling in the back end, and hoping kids like Evan Bouchard can step up. The Canucks are recalculating after a series of off-season departures. Tyler Toffoli has been a giant pain in their butt, brutalizing his old team in every match-up. Meanwhile, the Habs can’t stop grinning.


The Calgary Flames have been average despite adding some Canucks in the off-season, while Johnny Gaudreau has upped his trade value with a solid start. The Leafs are flying on the strength of a dominant power play, connecting at 43%. The Winnipeg Jets are holding on while they wait for Pierre-Luc Dubois to finish his quarantine. The hole in Ottawa can’t be patched.


Next week we’ll bring our first quarter review of the Canadian division.


Raptors Racket

On Tuesday Fred VanVleet made Raptors history in their win over the Orlando Magic. With 54 points in the win, VanVleet topped DeMar DeRozan’s record of 52. The showing also set a record for most points in one game by an undrafted NBA player, surpassing the 53-point record held by Moses Malone. 


The win left the Raptors at 9-12 heading into a tough 6-game road trip that may be definitive for their season. Time is running out to gain ground.


Blue Jays Babble

The Jays have used this off-season to transition their batting order to one of the most formidable in the American League East. If they want to make real noise, pundits agree they need to add a starting pitcher to their rotation. On Tuesday they brought back Francisco Liriano on a minor league contract. He’ll be given a chance to make the roster out of camp, but this wasn’t the addition fans wanted. It’s a bit like showing up for an east coast lobster boil and getting served Captain Highliner.


Curling Clamour

The 2021 Newfoundland and Labrador Tankard was held from January 27-31 at the RE/MAX Centre in St. John’s. Sarah Hill and her rink won the Newfoundland and Labrador Scotties Tournament of Hearts and will represent the province in Calgary from February 20-28. Skip Greg Smith and his crew will represent NL at the Tim Horton’s Brier in Calgary from March 5-14. 


A Newfoundlander living in Toronto, I’m occasionally prouder of my roots than usual. Last winter I told stories in an office building at Bay and Bloor about a snowstorm out east that had kids snowboarding in the downtown. I was teary more than once at the Royal Alexandra Theatre watching the Come From Away performance. I also had a curling moment.


In February 2006, I was running errands at a mall in the west end of Toronto when I encountered an electronics store with a TV in the window. Olympic Curling was on, and I stood there alone and watched Brad Gushue and his crew win the Gold Medal for Canada. 

I swear I had goosebumps. Patrick Roy hoisting the Cup goosebumps. I mean the Joe Carter home run kind goosebumps. Kawhi Leonard draining the buzzer-beater goosebumps. Saku Koivu returning from cancer goosebumps. You get the picture. But this was curling. 


All I’m saying is keep an eye on those curlers heading to national bonspiels. You never know when one of your own might end up being the best in the world. ",

      body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Council got underway just prior to a storm last Tuesday night, Feb. 2. The storm knocked out power from Port aux Basques to Port au Port, but not before Council concluded the evening’s business.


Dangerous Intersection

A resident from East End Channel told Council that the lack of street lighting almost resulted in two vehicle-pedestrian collisions over the winter holidays. The resident had been walking with his young son and dog near Lillington Avenue and Legallais Street, and the lack of lighting rendered them almost invisible to passing vehicles. Both times the parent reacted quickly enough to prevent a collision, but asked Council to speak to Newfoundland Hydro about installing a proper street light before a tragedy occurs.

Coun. Melvin Keeping reminded Council that Public Works had petitioned for a street light at that intersection in Sept. 2020, and received assurances that one would be put in place.

“We are at the mercy of light and power,” noted Keeping, then added, “We will press them, let them know the urgency.”

Public Works will also take a look around town to determine other areas that need lighting installed.


Pandemic Fatigue

Another resident wrote to Council asking that the town restart some of the town’s programs for parents and toddlers, noting that there has been no known case of COVID-19 in the region. The town had shut down the programs near the beginning of the pandemic.

The resident noted that being isolated with two small children can take a toll on people’s emotional and mental well-being, and that even a small outing while continuing to adhere to pandemic protocols would be welcome.

Council has sent the request to the Recreation Committee to see what can be done. Mayor John Spencer noted that dance class has resumed, and he himself goes to the Bruce II Sports Centre facility two days a week.

“We are easing back, which is great to see,” noted Spencer.


Stephenville Airport

Port aux Basques has been invited to submit the name of a council member who might be suitable to serve on the board of the Stephenville Airport Corporation. The board hopes to have a more regional presence, and currently has two vacant seats. Coun. Ches Coffin had been nominated to serve on the board shortly after Council was elected in 2017.

“Somehow it got lost in the shuffle and with six months left in this Council, I only see it fitting that we do get involved,” said Mayor Spencer. “The air ambulance issue alone that we have to protect and preserve, is a critical piece that we don’t want to lose.”


Tender Awarded

The town has awarded the tender for a new loader to Brat Tractor at a cost of $315,823 plus HST. There were three submissions for the tender, but prospective trade-in value played a role in deciding the successful tender. Town clerk Julia Ingram advised that the new loader should arrive by April 1.


Economic Development

The town’s Economic Development officer, Shauna Strickland, told Council that the CEP grant has concluded. Under the grant, the town employed 20 people who banked 4,189 insurable hours towards employment benefits.

The JCP grant to build an additional 900 feet of trail to link the existing Grand Bay West trail to Hopedale Avenue was not able to be completed due to the cost of materials. Strickland will be submitting another funding application so that the project can be completed this spring.

The committee will also continue to explore locations before determining a final site for the new farmer’s market. Besides the train museum, sites that are being considered include Scott’s Cove Park and Andy’s Rainbow Park.


Rat Setback

The town’s funding application to deal with rats by installing large plastic garbage bins was denied. Strickland advised that this was due to lack of a long term plan, and that reaching into deep bins would eventually result on stress and back injuries for workers.

Coun. Jim Lane said that the rat problem affects waste management too, and that the problem isn’t going away so alternatives must be explored.

Mayor Spencer isn’t a fan of the bins, saying they’re too light given our winds, too deep to empty and too heavy to roll out to the curb. He’d rather see residents maintain their garbage boxes properly so that rats can’t get in.

He mentioned that one garbage box that had been emptied by town staff only that morning was already filled up beyond capacity again, and the next collection wouldn’t come for another week. Other boxes have garbage residue in them that has been there for years.

“It looks like our people aren’t doing their jobs,” said Spencer. “We need to take it in a different direction so that we don’t have the same issues that we had last summer with all the rats.”

Council will resubmit the application for funding, but Public Works will continue to explore alternative measures. One idea was to mandate that wooden garbage boxes be lined with chicken wire to keep the rats out.",

      body: "A whole generation of people like me, having reached the age of retirement, expect to start enjoying a more peaceful, restful period far from the hustle and bustle of what has often been termed the “Rat Race”. But unless one is of the small minority who have managed to salt away a small fortune or defied overwhelming odds and won the lottery, their dream is often quickly dashed.


Take, for example, the way the Canada Revenue Agency claws back a substantial portion of the pension plan we have contributed to for all our working years. It’s far from me to begrudge the help the Federal Government has provided to the country’s workers who are now struggling to put food on their table or keep a roof over their head, thanks in part to COVID-19, but it does seem that the same treatment should be afforded to the senior generation.


We also need to eat!


In addition, in most cases, some require medication, which they either have to venture out to procure at the drugstore or have delivered at an additional cost. The measly $500 one-time stipend sent some months ago doesn’t go far if it’s a condition that will always necessitate medication.


Having contributed to the economy of the country, served the community in any number of ways, paid taxes either directly or through their purchases, it seems to me highly unfair that seniors appear to be an afterthought of the governments at all levels.


Safety net, they will say!


Allow me to point out that the very income tax programs we paid into, and that form the basis for these safety nets, are being “re-taxed” when even the Old Age Security money is reduced as is the Canada Pension, meager as it already is.


I have no way of verifying this, but I am convinced that I am not the only one who has to depend on his children to provide for a roof or other services. At my age, I naturally thought it prudent and responsible to give up my driving license.


Therefore, I now have to rely on them to drive me around, either to a doctor’s appointment, or to fetch my prescriptions at the pharmacy. These adults have their own lives and are facing financial obstacles of their own as the cost of living escalates while wages do not, and a global pandemic that is crippling the economy isn’t helping. 


I had visions of spending my declining years in a warmer climate, walking leisurely on some faraway beach, admiring the sunset and other beautiful sights, and not have to contend with the reality of snow, ice, and the never-relenting wind that is the norm in our part of the province. 


Alas, the reality of my circumstances is that I am here, bundled up with a heavy parka, with a tuque and mittens on, having to ask one of my children to abandon their current task in order to drive me to some appointment, or to go get a loaf of bread or some other necessity.

Of course I still dream of the beach, of the sun on my back, of sitting at some outdoor bar with a mojito or some other exotic drink, served by some friendly staff. But it shall remain exactly that – a dream.


It seems to me that the golden age is little more than the age of second class citizenship. So like countless others like me, I will dream of a better world where, when their turn comes, my children will not be a forgotten generation too dependent on their own children and living off whatever scraps all levels of government graciously dole out after a lifetime of taxing them egregiously for being responsible, contributing members of society.


Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll stop complaining and go back to sitting in the corner.",

      body: "Port aux Basques Mayor John Spencer has confirmed multiple rumours that a local player for the Western Kings midget hockey team is now in isolation after a health advisory from Public Health.


'The notification came officially today. This is all part of the umbrella of contact tracing relating to the surge on the East Coast,' stated Spencer via e-mail. 'The hockey team based out of Corner Brook (Western Kings) were on the East Coast for a tournament this past weekend.'


Until Thursday, Feb. 11, players with the Western Kings were not ordered to isolate as a precautionary measure. Multiple communities on the West Coast have players on that roster.


Despite speculation on social media, there remains no confirmation of any positive case in the town of Port aux Basques.


Responding to inquiries, NLESD has issued the following statement.


'The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District takes its advice from Public Health on all matters related to the ongoing pandemic. While we cannot speak to individual circumstances due to privacy, any families advised yesterday by public health to isolate as a precaution would have done so.   The District has not been advised of any positive cases in the school or region. St. James Regional High School was not closed yesterday, and remains open today in Scenario 1 (with enhanced safety protocols) and we continue to liaise with our partners in public health.'


Mayor Spencer also urged people to remain calm and diligent and not panic as events continue to unfold across the island.


'Time to stand tall. The circle has expanded closing all schools on the Avalon. Pray for calm. Newfoundland had dodged a bullet. However, reality has stepped in. COVID can and will hang its ugly hat anyway we allow. It is super contagious. Public Health is our best teacher to knock this virus down. Isolate. Physical distance. Hygiene. Masks. Limit contacts. But most importantly stay calm,' wrote Spencer. 'Patience and kindness towards others. No one asks for COVID. Pray that today will bring better news. We know our enemy. A collective effort on our part will guarantee better results. Staying alert. Staying safe. Avoiding situations putting health at risk.'


Port aux Basques Minor Hockey has directed any further inquiries to Hockey NL. Updates will follow as soon as more information is available.",

      body: "You probably heard that Canadian actor Christopher Plummer died. One of his claims to fame as an actor was playing the character Captain von Trapp in the movie musical The Sound of Music. Plummer performed alongside Julie Andrews who was a most troublesome novice nun who could sing the birds out of the trees. After moving in to care for his children, Andrews as Maria, becomes romantically involved with von Trapp. Predictably she leaves the convent to eventually take on the role of wife and step-mother to a large family. One the songs of the musical that always plays in my head is that of the Mother Superior singing “How do you solve a problem like Maria” when poor Maria was having trouble fitting in.


I hope I am not too distracting with the lead to this column. Hopefully it will connect as we go along. As this is being written news of the delay in voting in the eastern part of the province is known. This means the overall election result will not be known for a while at least. Regardless of the outcome, Canada as the national government may too be singing a new version of the aforementioned song: How do you solve a problem like Newfoundland and Labrador?


Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949 on the heels of a referendum that gave back responsible government to what was then a country. Here it is now, some 70 years later and the province is staring down a situation that we have seen before.


When Newfoundland joined Canada after the Commission of Government years, the then country had a modest surplus of cash. My information is that this was in the order of $30 million. This, no doubt, was to a large extent the result of the efforts of the non-elected Commission which ran the country for 15 years. Today things are upside down again as the province struggles to keep the lights on and pay the salaries of civil servants. The accumulated debt is now unsustainable to the point that there appears there will be no choice other than that the national government – Ottawa, will need to come to the rescue.

Having spent most of my years living in the province I feel very much a part of all of this. 


The people that the Premier appointed to study the province’s economic situation have quite a challenge ahead. As a non-elected advisory body, they will make their report and leave it to the elected representatives to do with it what they will. If you study the history of Newfoundland’s troubled past there was a similar exercise in the years leading up to Commission of Government in 1934.


Let’s be clear, Newfoundland is not alone in facing financial headwinds. Ontario is reported to have the highest debt of any subnational government in the world. Saskatchewan faced down a pretty horrible financial situation some years ago. Canada has borrowed over 400 billion dollars this year because of the pandemic and other provinces have had to manage new financial circumstances.


What really separates this province from others is its declining (and older) population, government expenditures that on a per capita basis are the highest in the country and a landmass which drives up the cost of providing government services. Add to this a misguided hydro project (Muskrat Falls) that ballooned in cost and created even more debt. Newfoundland and Labrador’s indebtedness (highest per capita in Canada) and its inherent disadvantages, by virtue of geography and demographics, leaves it extremely vulnerable. Other jurisdictions can bear high debt more durably even though after the pandemic there will be a reckoning for all in this country.


All political parties acknowledge the province will have to get creative with Ottawa, or maybe the other way around. Ottawa is the Mother Superior who will have to help Newfoundland and Labrador solve its financial problems. Quite unfortunately, the provincial election did little to shed much light on the impact of the financial situation and any talk of bankruptcy was not welcome. Criticism for holding the election before the report of the economic recovery team is probably justified, although I think the province’s voters know things have to change.


As in the musical, a nice and thoughtful song did not make things better for Maria in the convent nor does an election change the gravity of the financial situation facing the province. It just heightens the urgency to take charge of the problem. Citizens will need to be patient and enduring through it all. The forecasts from some of the pundits paint a pretty grim picture of how the province will need to function in the years ahead. I have little to offer as to how things may be set aright. I can tell you one thing - as a former resident and patriot, I too will feel the pain.

      subtitles: "Guest columnist John Spencer is the mayor of Channel-Port aux Basques.",
      body: "Winter has arrived. Let the snow wars begin. No, not Star Wars. Snow Wars. Whose snow is it anyway?


This reminds one of the play written by the late Newfoundland humorist, Ted Russell, ‘The Hangashore’. Although, it was in a completely reversed context, it did end up in a court of law. There was little doubt this was a skirmish started by the cold of a winter season. Who owned a hole in the ice? Holes in the ice for fishing in the middle of winter were as prized back then as holes in the ice are today. Fishing is always a little easier using another man’s hole.


Back to today’s dilemma. It revolves around the white stuff and where do you put it without upsetting your neighbour, or the town, as far as that goes. Even for towns, it is a troubling concern. Remember last winter during SNOWMAGEDDON (How could we forget? CBC St. John’s won’t shut up about it.) when the City of St. John’s had to get special permission from the ‘green sweepers’ to dump the mountains of snow into the harbour. The same snow, one might add, would end up there in spring run off. Best kept secret all across NL towns. No dumping in the harbour. So, our towns are as troubled as residents are about where to put the snow. Not even going there on the cost to rid ourselves of something nature will take away with time.


For those who remember a world before cell phones, winter in Port aux Basques (PAB), was always interesting. United Church administrators, at the school where Home Hardware in PAB is today, pleading with the Church of England flock – who not only had the geographic advantage of being higher up the hill, but the numbers of students to boot – to stop pelting thousands of snowballs in the direction of the UC academy. It was as if the good students at St. James were always starting things. Good luck with that. Normally, truces came quickly when the towering figure of a man, the vice-principal at St. James, would move through his flock seeking ring leaders. Of course, there was never anyone from the fish plant area bearing the righteous, Pleasant Street sign. The Boys from the Brook, or more likely the Channellers, were always in the thick of things regardless of religious persuasion.


The love of a great snowball fight brought the best of us to look the other way – all for the love of winter, when simpler things dominated cultural goings-on in town, all before PAB ended separate schools based on religion, and a stadium was built in the 60s that turned everyone’s attention to the love of hockey, broom ball, bowling, curling, and figure skating. The midnight skates at the Bruce are still cherished in memory closets.


Now, back to the question at hand. What to do with the snow? Can’t push it on the road. That is not allowed. Can’t push it on the sidewalk. That is not allowed. Can’t blow it on your neighbours lot. Well, you can with permission, and as long as it is not directed at the fragile plastic siding. Can’t...Can’t...Can’t...That is a whole lot of can’ts. So just what is a person to do with the snow?


One would guess the answer lies somewhere in the term, ‘satisficing’. Do the best that you can and try not to upset too many in the process. In plain English, try not become the topic of the morning at the local Java shop. Whatever the outcome, a person has to ensure not to have a reputation tarnished. You never know. Talk of a ‘Hangashore’ in a neighbourhood certainly won’t sit well. (Dictionary of Newfoundland English might help you with this term).

Remember Ted Russell’s story of someone stealing another person’s hole?


The circuit court judge threw the case out. Lack of evidence. By the time the boys had their day in court, spring had arrived, and the ice was gone. There was no proof of a hole in the first place. Without proof there was no case. On the upside, spring is a little more than a month away.


Kindness and patience, please.",

Newfoundland saw a significant spike in COVID-19 cases last week that resulted in a provincial lockdown and a shift to exclusively mail-in voting. - via YOUTUBE",
      body: "SOUTHWEST COAST – After the province saw over 250 cases of COVID-19 last week, it likely came as no surprise that Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, raised the provincial alert level to 5. On Friday evening, Feb. 12, Fitzgerald called a second emergency news briefing to confirm that the outbreak had been identified as a B117 variant strain, which is believed to be more contagious.


“We know that if not controlled, it becomes a predominant strain within weeks of first appearance,” said Fitzgerald.


She also stated that all new cases since Feb. 5 are believed to be the B117 variant, which would include the single new case in Western that was announced last Wednesday, Feb. 10. That case is believed to be travel-related and not part of the St. John’s metro outbreak.

By the time Fitzgerald moved the province back to alert level 5 on Friday evening, she had already ordered special measures that affected local facilities like the Bruce II Sports Complex, which closed last Wednesday.


On Thursday, the Western Kings hockey team, based in Corner Brook, announced that their players had been ordered into isolation. A player on an opposing team had tested positive, and the Kings have players from around the region, including Port aux Basques. That news was confirmed by Mayor John Spencer via e-mail later that evening.


“The notification came officially today. This is all part of the umbrella of contact tracing relating to the surge on the East Coast,” stated Spencer via e-mail. “The hockey team based out of Corner Brook (Western Kings) were on the East Coast for a tournament this past weekend.”


Meanwhile Hockey NL suspended operations throughout the province indefinitely.

“Upon learning on Feb. 5 and 6, 2021 that some participants within our organization had possibly been exposed to the Covid-19 virus, and in compliance and agreement with Public Health advisories, Hockey NL made the decision to cancel a number of events,” stated Craig Tulk, Executive Director of Hockey NL, in a news release. “This has quite understandably created some concern within our membership and our communities.”


Despite rumours to the contrary, schools remained open on the Southwest Coast with the exception of Belanger Memorial, which had water problems.


“St. James Regional High School was not closed yesterday (Feb. 11), and remains open today in Scenario 1 (with enhanced safety protocols) and we continue to liaise with our partners in public health,” stated Cheryl Gullage on behalf of the Newfoundland and Labrador English School District (NLESD).


Despite NLESD’s reassurances, on Friday afternoon many students at St. James High School in Port aux Basques chose to walk out of class. Ashton Bragg, 16, was one of those students.


“A lot of people walked out, yes. I was one of them,” said Bragg, citing the walk out was for, “Safety mostly.”


After Fitzgerald’s Friday evening presser, NLESD announced via social media that it was switching to Scenario 3, which is online learning for all K-12 schools in all regions.


In Port aux Basques, the Salvation Army closed its community kitchen, its Thrift Store, and will not accept donations. Port aux Basques closed its town office to the public, the Public Library closed, the waste management depot at Cape Ray halted drop off for residential customers, and even private businesses like the Hungry Newfie restaurant, located in the Hotel-Port aux Basques, decided to close its doors for the next two weeks. DRL buses are also suspended indefinitely.


Stores that remain open are restricting the number of shoppers permitted inside at any given time. Some have also mandated that face masks must be worn and will no longer permit shields, after a mid-January news brief by Fitzgerald and Minister of Health Dr. John Haggie clarified that they were not suitable to prevent spread of the virus.


“Face shields are not an alternative to masks, as they are open and let droplets escape,” noted Fitzgerald.


Dr. David Thomas, Chief of Staff at the Dr. Charles L. LeGrow Hospital in Port aux Basques, urged diligence. Like Fitzgerald, he cautions people to behave as though the virus is everywhere, even on the Southwest Coast.


“It is safe to assume that COVID-19 could be located and spreading in all regions within our province. It is not a time for panic, but complacency will be our downfall. Everyone should behave as if the individual next to them unknowingly has the virus,” said Thomas. “We should always follow Dr Fitzgerald’s advice and wash our hands frequently, avoid touching our face, practice physical distancing and wear a mask in public indoor spaces. 


Downloading the COVID Alert app will also provide an extra layer of defence and help our public health staff with contact tracing. This is definitely not a time for gatherings or parties. Stay safe.”


The new measures also resulted in the cancellation of in-person voting across the entire province. Shortly after Fitzgerald’s Friday evening presser, Chief Electoral Officer Bruce Chaulk issued a statement.


“In-person voting will not be rescheduled,” stated Chaulk. “The election will now shift exclusively to voting by mail.”


Chaulk also extended the deadline to vote by mail.


“We have extended the application deadline to Monday, February 15 at 8:00 p.m. Anyone requiring assistance with the application process is encouraged to call our toll free number 1-877-729-7987.”


All completed voting kits must be returned to Elections NL on or before Monday, March 1, 2021.


Premier and Liberal Party leader Andrew Furey has taken considerable heat on social media and during the press conferences for his decision to call the election. In a separate media-only Zoom meeting following last Wednesday’s press conference, he pointed out – not for the first time – that when the election was first called the province was still enjoying a relatively low number of cases and had been for quite some time.


“As I said many times in the last week, we had come out of Christmas and New Years without significant spikes and the best evidence available to me then was that this was a safe time to do it, after consultations,” said Furey. “You’re never confident until its over, but I’m confident in our party, I’m confident in the platform that we put through, I’m confident in the vision for the province that we’ve laid out. It’s an unfortunate circumstance that we’re in now with the virus.”


Later that same evening Andrew Parsons (Burgeo-La Poile) pointed out that in 2020, even the opposition was in favour of an election.


“The other parties were saying bring on the elections. Ches Crosbie’s team had the signs bought. They were saying bring it on, bring it on,” said Parsons via phone interview. “If you didn’t call it, this would still happen. This is not election related.”


He also pointed out that we’ve had cases in the interim, and there was no way to predict such a large outbreak, and that there’s always pros and cons to calling an election at any time.


“We have had outbreaks – not of the same proportion – but we have had outbreaks,” said Parsons via phone interview, “Even without the outbreak, campaigns are stressful, busy, anxious times.”


Parsons noted that NL is not the only province who has called an election during a global pandemic.


“The fact that we’ve had three other provinces have elections, with higher case numbers, and managed them successfully leads me to believe that this one could have went the same way. However the reality that we’re faced with is that we do have an outbreak. I do think that Public Health is the number one priority of everybody.”


Parsons has been urging voters to opt into special ballots from the outset. He says that in-person voting hasn’t been very high for years anyway.


“You’re barely hitting 50 percent participation,” he said. “A lot of people don’t vote by choice, or by inability for various reasons.”


Turnout for special ballots is up. In 2019, just over 19,000 people opted for special ballot. Even before Chaulk halted all in-person voting, that number increased to 33,000.

In the near future, Parsons would like to see electronic voting offered as an option.


“I see it as a greater opportunity to participate.”",

Securing constrution objects like this door (bottom right), is important to prevent damage to both property and people. - SUBMITTED",
      body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The Wreckhouse winds are legendary, but much of the rest of the Southwest coast also gets more than its fair share of excessive winds.

Robert Musseau lives in Grand Bay, and he can attest that even here in town the winds can cause significant destruction. 


Last Tuesday, Feb. 2, Musseau’s car was all but destroyed after by strong winds battered his 2018 Chevrolet Equinox with a door.


“It was an old interior door that was probably left outside after someone did renovations,” speculates Musseau. “There was no door earlier that evening. Just brought the dog in when we heard the loud bang.”


In fact, the bang was so loud that even the neighbours ventured out to see what had happened.


“Went outside and found a piece of a door on my front patio. Thought it just hit the house and damaged the siding,” explains Musseau.


Upon closer inspection, he discovered the door had also struck his vehicle with enough force to shatter the windshield and send glass raining down inside onto the front seats.


“I noticed the vehicle’s windshield when (I went) closer for a better look and was taken aback with all the damage to the vehicle,” says Musseau.


Whether or not the car can be fixed or will have to be replaced entirely is still unknown. Musseau says an insurance adjuster has yet to assess the extent of the damage. Either way it seems likely he will take a financial hit as well, something Musseau says “sucks big time”.


“I’ve got to go through my own insurance for the vehicle, and if I want the house siding fixed I will need to go through my home insurance.”


Assuming the vehicle is repaired instead of being written off entirely, Musseau estimates its re-sale value drops by about $2000 because it will have been flagged as having an accident.

Despite that, Musseau says he is just thankful that nobody got hurt. He recommends people secure any items laying around their property if a windstorm is in the forecast.


“Some one could have gotten seriously hurt or killed by that door.”",

NHL Noise

It’s hard to believe, but it’s time for the first quarter report for the 2020-21 season. Here are some good signs and bad omens for each Canadian team, from the basement to the attic. 

 

Hockey pundits predicted the Ottawa Senators would finish in the basement of the Scotia North Division. With a 2-11-1 record to start the season, the Sens are looking up to the basement from that dirt cellar space where your grandfather kept his turnips. 


Good signs – The Sens have one of the best prospect pools in the NHL, and some kids are already paying dividends. Tim Stützle, the 3rd overall pick of the 2020 draft, is the real deal.


Bad omens – That strong prospect pool needs veteran support, and those added in the off-season are not working out as planned. Braydon Coburn has already been waived while Derek Stepan has asked for a trade.  



The most surprising team may be the Vancouver Canucks with a 6-10-0 start to the season. I don’t think they’re making the playoffs.


Good signs – Brock Boeser. That kid is a true offensive weapon.


Bad omens – Elias Pettersson had a slow start and Quinn Hughes is a sieve in his own end. The kids could use help, but even if there were immediate options available, GM Jim Benning doesn’t have two nickels to rub together. The Canucks are in cap hell. 



With a 6-5-1 start to the season, the Calgary Flames look like they will compete for the final playoff spot in the North.


Good signs – While they started slow, the Flames have been improving with each game. Sam Bennett, he of the early season trade request, has settled in on the first line with Johnny Gaudreau and Sam Monahan. 


Bad omens – Consistency is this team’s biggest issue, and that last spot for the playoffs will be a toss up between two or three teams. 



The Edmonton Oilers are the tragedy of the NHL. They own the best centre tandem in the league, in their prime, and four GMs have not been able to build a team around them. They opened the season with an 8-7-0 record and will battle for the 4th playoff spot in the division.


Good signs – Jesse Puljujarvi is settling back in and Kailer Yamamoto picked up where he left off. The big three – Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins – are still carrying the team offensively.


Bad omens – The Oilers D was never a juggernaut but losing Oscar Klefbom for the season created a giant hole in front of the weakest goalie tandem in the North. An injury to Mike Smith left Mikko Koskinen carrying a bigger load than he’s built for. 




Despite their fair share of distractions, the Winnipeg Jets are off to a 7-4-1 start. 


Good signs – After all the jigs and reels, the Jets have a fantastic punch down the middle of the ice. Nicolaj Ehlers has had a brilliant start and is making up for points lost with Patrik Laine’s departure. 


Bad omens – The Jets may have the best goalie in Canada in Connor Hellebyck, but that D group has more gaps than a lobster pot.




With and 8-3-2 record to start season, the Montreal Canadiens are the most improved team in the division. I expect them to compete with the Jets for 2nd place in the North.


Good signs – Everything Bergevin is coming up roses. Forward additions Tyler Toffoli and Josh Anderson lead the team in goals. Jake Allen has four wins as back-up. The kids – Nick Suzuki, Jesperi Kotkaniemi, Jake Evans and Alexander Romanov – are filling big roles. Corey Perry has proven useful from the taxi squad. 


Bad omens – The Habs usually start well – even bad Habs teams. They were less than dominant in their first 2-game series against the Ottawa Senators, which ended up giving fans the fits. Questions also surround veterans in contract years who find their roles changing.




At the top of the North Division are the Toronto Maple Leafs with an 11-2-1 record. The Leafs are favourites to win the division.


Good signs – The mustache may be creepier than a leech in your drawers, but it’s hard to criticize the start from Auston Matthews. That, combined with the strength of their power play, has the Leafs expecting to win every night.


Bad omens – They’ve already experienced several significant injuries with few options to replace from within. The Leafs cap situation is tighter than a frog’s arse, which we all know is waterproof.




Raptors Racket

After a tough start to the season, the Raptors are 12-13 and in the thick of the playoff hunt. It’s been a while since they’ve had to sneak in the back door, but this season they’ll take any door to the post-season. In the coming weeks management will need to decide if they can afford to be buyers at the trade deadline.


Blue Jays Babble

The Toronto Blue Jays are due to open spring training on February 18th. Dunedin, Florida is the home of their spring training facility and players are gradually making their way there. Significant questions remain about where they will begin their regular season. With the Canadian border closed to international travel, it is doubtful the Jays will be able to play their home games in Toronto.


Funny isn’t it? The Jays want to stay home and the rest of us are scratching to get out.

      subtitles: "Gerry Samms, shown (above) at his roaster,  is the entrepreneur behind Granddaddy’s Roastery, an artisinal coffee brand he launched in an effort to get “a good cup of coffee”. - COURTESY OF MELISSA SAMMS",
      body: "MILLVILLE – “Tim Horton’s doesn’t do it. It’s too far away,” laughs Gerry Samms. “It was borne out of not being able to get a good cup of coffee.” 


In order to get his good cup of coffee, Samms launched Granddaddy’s Roastery sometime around 2015. If nothing else, he would at least cut down on his drive time.


“It didn’t seem to matter where I went. The closest decent cup of coffee was Brewed Awakenings in Corner Brook,” offers Samms.


Over five years later, the sole proprietor and resident coffee concourse is quietly developing a niche market and loyal following for his freshly roasted coffee beans. Despite the coffee’s brand name, Samms is not actually a granddaddy.


“I’m next to Granddaddy’s Brook,” he says.


Samms imports the green beans in bulk wholesale. They come in huge sacks, some weighing as much as 130 pounds. The most recent order he placed was for a little over 630 pounds.


“This order is Costa Rica, Columbia, and I think I had one Guatemalan in there.”


He tends to stick to South African green beans for the most part, though he will order in from Africa every now and again too.


“I find the African ones too expensive unless I wanted a small order for myself,” says Samms. “I don’t think it would sell. You’re getting into coffee that you would need to sell for 23, 24 dollars a pound.”


Granddaddy’s coffee is an artisanal coffee. Artisanal coffees tend to be smoother, more flavourful and more complex and considered more distinguished. Roasters of artisanal coffees are mindful of the delicate balance between the oils, aromas and flavour when roasting their coffee, and Samms is no exception.


“It’s mostly based on senses. There’s nothing automatic about my roaster.”


Samms’ roaster is actually a barbecue fitted with a special rotating drum inside that roasts the beans to his exacting standards. The unit requires a minimum of 40,000 BTUs to roast the beans at around 600 degrees. It’s not as simple as chucking some beans into a barbecue and yanking it out after a few hours.


A true artist, Samms takes every conceivable factor into consideration when roasting, because it can all affect the delicate beans and the end result flavour.


“Depending on the day, the weather, the ambient temperature and whatnot, I can do a 10 pound roast in about 25 to 30 minutes,” explains Samms.


If it seems tricky to calculate roasting time based on humidex, Samms seems to have it figured out. He says he’s only scorched one batch.


“It’s like a blowtorch going off,” he laughs.


While big brand coffee producers rely on automatic roasters to tell them when a bean is ready, for Samms it is entirely sensory.


“It’s an artisanal thing. It’s the amount of time that it’s been in there. It’s the crack of the coffee. You can hear it cracking. It’s almost like popcorn popping.”


Samms doesn’t wait until the cracking is finished, because if it cracks a second time the bean goes from a medium roast to a dark roast or even an espresso-type coffee.


“By that time the roots of the coffee – when I say the roots of the coffee I mean the origin of the coffee – is gone,” explains Samms.


Before he even started roasting, Samms learned as much as he could about the process. He says it’s still a learning process.


“I would hope that I never give up that learning process. At no point do you ever get to know everything about the topic.”


When he wants to blend the bean, he does so after roasting. That’s because beans from different regions don’t always roast at the same rate. Samms’ love of coffee can be traced back to his career working in foreign countries. An offshore worker, he’s spent time in South East Asia, West Africa, Russia and his last 15 years before retirement were spent in South America. Samms was immersed in local culture, cuisine and coffee.


“In South America you get some of the best coffee that I’ve drank anywhere,” he offers. “I said if they can do it here, there’s absolutely no reason why I can’t take their bean and do it at home.”


He was still working in South America when he first began experimenting with roasting his own beans.


Granddaddy’s Roastery coffee is available at a couple of stores that tend to carry locally sourced and crafted products, such as E. W. (Hockey) Gale’s Store in Millville, or at Main Street Convenience in Port aux Basques. It’s $15 per pound, and customers can also order directly from the Roastery via telephone at 695-8999.


“I still have a few customers that order directly from the roastery,” says Samms. “It’s the same price as it is at Hockey’s.”


Samms says that so far he’s received nothing but positive feedback from the local coffee lovers.


“One guy here in the Valley, he said, ‘That’s all I drink now’, so that’s a nice compliment,” chuckles Samms.

      body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – After an unseasonably warm start, winter finally arrived in early February and packing its usual wallop. In addition to the high winds and a power outage, plows hit the streets to tackle the first serious snowfall to hit the region.


Plowing even a relatively smaller town can be a headache for municipalities and residents alike. Along with the financial expenditure, there’s also a cost in time and inconvenience.

On-street parking is prohibited in Port aux Basques from Dec. 31 to Apr. 1, and is typically enforced from midnight until 8:00 a.m. and within the 12 hour window following a storm. Clearing the streets during the wee hours when people are sleeping is done for safety reasons according to Town Manager Leon MacIsaac.


“Snowclearing is typically completed after business hours to reduce interaction between vehicles and heavy equipment. Drivers are not typically aware that they are required to keep a safe distance from heavy equipment which requires larger sightlines to safely operate. Vehicles often get too close to equipment when operating which increases the risk of an accident,” wrote MacIsaac in response to e-mail inquiries.


That can be a hassle for those who don’t have a driveway or access to an off-street private parking spot. MacIsaac says that Port aux Basques is aware of this difficulty for some residents.


“There are a limited number of streets where it may be impossible to keep the vehicles completely off the road. In these circumstances allowances may be made depending on the conditions and each is addressed accordingly,” wrote MacIsaac.


However the town doesn’t have a public parking lot, so the responsibility to source a spot remains with the vehicle owner. Those who can’t find one may find their vehicle has been ticketed or even towed, although towing is a last resort after the owner has ignored the initial ticket and continues to park illegally. The town does not set the fees for the towing, noted MacIsaac.


“The cost to the owner of the vehicle would be the towing fee from the applicable towing company and any fees that company may charge for having it stored on their property. The vehicle would not be released until documentation is provided that all applicable fees have been paid.”


Snow clearing cost Port aux Basques taxpayers a bit in excess of $425,000 according to the 2019 budget figures.


MacIsaac says that part of dealing with snow removal is figuring out where to put it.


“Due to the limited availability of snow dumping areas the process to complete all aspects is time consuming,” wrote MacIsaac.


Like larger metropolitan areas, Port aux Basques tends to prioritize its main traffic thoroughfares before clearing more residential streets. Cul-de-sacs or dead end streets tend to be lower on the list, and after that, snowplow operators will return to widen the streets or push back more of the snow.


To a large extent that strategy makes sense. Emergency services must be able to respond in the event of an emergency. But what about those without vehicles, or who have mobility issue?


“It would not be functional or practical to clear sidewalks until this process is completed,” explained MacIsaac. “Sidewalks in the area of schools are given priority for children walking to school and then the downtown pedestrian-thoroughfare areas to enable access.”


MacIsaac says the town does understand the importance of keeping the sidewalks cleared.

“Proving safe and accessible sidewalks have taken a higher priority but also comes at a very high cost. Unfortunately, sidewalks can not be made passable until the streets are fully cleared as it would only duplicate snow clearing efforts and make road clearing impractical,” wrote MacIsaac.


When sidewalks are not cleared, residents have no alternative but to walk alongside the snow covered roads just to get to the grocery store or doctor’s office for example. That practice has proven hazardous elsewhere within the province.


In a two week span in early Jan. 2020, one pedestrian was killed and eight others were injured in St. John’s after being struck by vehicles. In response the city, which has a snow clearing budget in excess of $18 million, pledged to do a better job of clearing its sidewalks.

One advantage of a larger city budget is purchasing equipment that is dedicated to just keeping the sidewalks accessible. For Port aux Basques, such an expenditure would almost double the annual cost of snow removal.


“A sidewalk plow costs approximately $150,000 per unit and are a high maintenance item. The typical rule of thumb is to have a second unit available in the event the original unit breaks down, which does happen when unknown objects (such as garbage nets, bags, etc.) are left out and become entangled in the chute/auger. This can lead to extended down time,” noted MacIsaac. “A municipality would need to factor approximately $300,000 for units that would be stationary for a large part of the year.”


MacIsaac also pointed out that Bobcats and Skidsteers are not practical for snow clearing sidewalks.


While Port aux Basques has its own staff to clear sidewalks, sometimes outside contractors may be called in to help, usually after an onslaught of storms that result in significant snowfall accumulation.


Unlike other provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador does not have a law requiring home and property owners to keep their sidewalks cleared of snow. Both the province of Ontario and the City of Toronto have laws in place requiring property owners to keep their sidewalks in front of their buildings free of snow and ice.


“I do know that it’s a topic that has come up frequently during conferences over the years but has not been enacted to date,” said MacIsaac.


But that bylaw doesn’t always work either. Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) tried it for a few years but ultimately repealed the bylaw.


“Approximately six years ago, HRM removed that bylaw and took over that component again with residents/businesses in affected areas charged a higher tax rate. HRM residents have complained the service is not as dependable when property owners had cleared it themselves,” wrote MacIsaac. “I expect a reinstatement of the bylaw may come up in the future.”


Enacting a similar law here would require provincial approval. In addition, it would require hiring an enforcement officer, which the town also cannot afford.


Mayor John Spencer observed that what is practical elsewhere doesn’t necessarily work for smaller Newfoundland towns. When he lived out west, Spencer chose to pay a private contractor to clear his access.


“In Moose Jaw and Saskatoon our vehicle would be lost in the ruts. You want to see the damage done hitting a sidewalk popping out of a rut. The policy in Saskatchewan is not practical here unless we substitute our vehicles for skidoos.”",

Her single, Fiery Hockey Blood, continues to earn the St. John’s musician praise and recognition. “Hockey is far more than just a game.” - COURTESY OF © ROGER MAUNDER",
      body: "ST. JOHN’S – Just because she never played hockey doesn’t mean musician Jackie Sullivan isn’t among the most passionate of fans. In fact, Jackie has so much fiery hockey blood that she had to write a song about it, a song that even Hockey Night in Canada (HNIC) noticed.

Originally Sullivan had applied to be on the Rogers Hometown Hockey viewing party, 

planning to take a bunch of kids with her to share a cool experience by appearing, however briefly, on HNIC. As part of that process, she ended up on a Zoom call with HNIC hosts Ron MacLean and Tara Slone.


“When Ron MacLean got on the Zoom call, the very first words out of his mouth were, ‘Is Jackie Sullivan here?’ and I almost died!”


Sullivan had sent her press release about her new single, Fiery Hockey Blood, to Rogers Hometown Hockey and Ron MacLean, but unbeknownst to her it had also come across his desk after Russell Bowers with CBC Alberta sent it in also.


“I wasn’t anticipating any conversation with Ron MacLean at all,” admits Sullivan. “I was completely sideswiped and I got really emotional.”


Sullivan says she could barely speak about her song when he invited her to do so. She believes that Newfoundland has a unique hockey culture – go hard or go home, never back down – she calls it. That’s what she documented in her press release.


After she told them about the province’s passion for the sport, mentioned some local heroes and legend Bob Cole who were featured in the video, Sloan made her a promise.


“Tara Sloan said ‘You have my word, when we are back on the road, we will use this as our anthem’,” says Sullivan.


Not long after that, MacLean mentioned Jackie on HNIC. Since then, Sullivan has continued marketing the song across North America. She has been interviewed by CBC NL and recently did an interview with Boston College where Alex Newhook attends school. Newhook, who is a Newfoundlander, played for Team Canada during the last World Juniors.

Sullivan vividly remembers the hunger on his face as Newhook come onto the ice and scored a goal against Russia, less than a minute into the game.


“That’s the fire that I’m talking about – fiery hockey blood. What he just demonstrated is exactly the sentiment behind the song,” says Sullivan. “What I’ve learned is that everybody seems to have a hockey story of some sort, you know?”


In fact, people have started reaching out to Sullivan from across the country, even sharing videos of themselves singing Fiery Hockey Blood. She says it’s all so incredible, particularly as she never anticipated such an overwhelming response to her song.


“As a song writer, it sometimes can be an unnerving process to pitch your music to the world. Ultimately you are giving a piece of yourself, of your soul really, so there’s no guarantee that people are going to like it,” admits Sullivan.


Combining her passion for hockey with her passion for music is a no-brainer. Sullivan grew up with music, surrounded by it in her home and community.


“I have vivid memories of 8-tracks and records and spending hours listening to them on the floor in my living room. I was 8 years old when I got my first guitar,” shares Sullivan.


Back then only her brothers played hockey, and girls usually didn’t play the sport, says Sullivan. In order to make up for dragging her around at all hours in a tiny Chevette, her parents bought her the guitar at Echo Music on Long’s Hill.


“It wasn’t something that I had asked for, but once I had it in my hands I spent hours and hours trying to learn and play on my own, and it was just something that I developed an incredible love for, and I started writing at a very young age,” recalls Sullivan.


She counts Anne Murray as one of the greater influences on her music, and owns most if not all of her albums. Sullivan even enjoyed a Zoom chat with her legendary idol not too long ago. She says Murray has a great sense of humour and is very down to earth.


“It was very much a dream come true for me,” she says. “I always loved Anne Murray’s voice, but I always loved her personality too.”


Sullivan says she likes old country as well, and tends to gravitate towards other female artists like Irish musician Mary Black. Like so many other artists, Sullivan has been impacted professionally by the pandemic. Prior to COVID-19, she was booked for a tour at venues across the province.


“It all had to be cancelled, and for someone like me,” she says, “I do this because it’s my passion, because I love it with my whole heart, and it’s just a part of who I am.”


Sullivan was also scheduled to perform in Ireland but that invariably got postponed too. She had been accepted to perform at the International Irish-Newfoundland Connections Festival, an event that usually takes place every year.


“I was supposed to perform in Southeast Ireland in August of 2020 and of course that didn’t happen,” says Sullivan. “I’ve never been to Ireland. I’ve never toured there. But I was so excited and looking forward to sharing my music and just performing in a place that feels like home.”


Her acceptance still stands, so once the festival resumes Sullivan still plans to go.


“I cannot wait for that to happen.”


While she waits to perform live again, Sullivan is happily enjoying the NHL players showcase their own fiery hockey blood, even in a shortened season. Her favourite team is the Montreal Canadiens.


“I really believe in the profound story behind the song, and I really believe it will resonate in the hearts of every hockey lover across this country.”",

      body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Some residents and front-line health care workers in this region have begun receiving COVID-19 vaccinations.


During Phase 1 of the roll out, vaccinations are prioritized for those considered most vulnerable by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI). That means people residing in long-term care homes, front-line healthcare workers, seniors 85 or older, and adults living in remote or isolated Indigenous communities will be vaccinated first.


“Our long term care residents and some staff at LeGrow received Moderna yesterday (Tuesday, Feb. 16),” confirmed Dr. David Thomas, Chief of Staff at the Dr. Charles L. LeGrow Health Centre. “Pfizer is here next week for residents of our personal care homes and more of our health care staff.”


As of Feb. 6, only 1.70% of the province had received their first dose of the vaccine, and 2.593% of the country has received at least one dose. Canada currently has one of the lowest dose rates in the world, at 3.52% as of Feb. 17, 2021.


“Western Health will be receiving trays of vaccine weekly from now on. They will be spread across the region,” says Thomas. “No word on general public yet.”


The general public are not scheduled to be vaccinated until Phase 3, and only after most high-risk priority groups have been immunized. Enough doses are expected to be available to vaccinate everyone in Canada by Fall 2021.


Erin Shea, Director of Communications for the Department of Health and Community Services responded to inquiries via e-mail.


 “The ultimate goal of Newfoundland and Labrador’s COVID-19 immunization plan is to immunize as many people as quickly as possible in an ethical and risk-stratified manner. The province is currently in Phase One of its immunization plan. Details are being finalized on future phases. Information on future phases will be provided publicly when it is available.”

      body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Thanks to the ongoing pandemic and the current provincial status set to Alert Level 5, Town Council opted to conduct its Feb. 16 meeting online with all councilors and several members of the public in attendance. Here are the highlights from the virtual meeting.


Previous business

After a resident complained about poor lighting that almost resulted in more than one vehicle-pedestrian collisions, NL Power installed new lighting in East End Channel.

A mother who wrote to Council asking them re-open some limited activities for parents and toddlers at the Bruce II Sports Centre must wait a bit longer to be reviewed further by the Recreation Committee thanks to the current lockdown. The Bruce II must remain closed under Alert Level 5 restrictions.


Fire department

After the department issued a call inviting new members, seven people submitted applications to become volunteer firefighters. There are currently three vacant spots on the roster.

Meanwhile work will begin on the new smokehouse in the spring. The department has three sea-cans it will use to build the new training site.

The department also plants to do some pre-incident training, which means visiting some businesses to assess their buildings and what hazards (i.e. dangerous chemicals) might be in place. More firefighters have also signed on for hazmat training.

The fire truck that used to be stationed at the Grand Bay garage will be sent to Fire and Emergency Services. Now that the Central fire station located downtown has its new pumper truck, the old pumper truck will relocate to the Grand Bay station.


Loader loan and tender

Now that the tender for the new loader has been awarded, Town Clerk Julia Ingram reached out to the three banks for a quote regarding the purchase loan. The Bank of Montreal (BMO) had the most favourable terms, and Council voted to approve that loan in the amount of $266,787.58 at 1.71 percent for a 5-year term.

This amount has the rebate factored out, since the Town will cover the rebate until it is returned, as is normal for any heavy equipment purchase.


Power maintenance

Deputy Mayor Todd Strickland told council about his dealings with NL Power and NL Hydro with regards to outages, technology and prevention. Prior to the last storm, NL Power sent extra crews to the area in anticipation of possible outages.

In Rose Blanche the remote start up did not work, however, and the system had to be started manually, so problems remain. In Port aux Basques, a backup generator that was not in place during the last outage because it needs repair still needs another week or two before it will be fixed. A letter will be sent out to NL re-stating Town’s position that the generator must remain here when it is not needed elsewhere.

Meanwhile Channel area residents are on the literal end of the line and the infrastructure is not designed to bypass a particular area in favour of another, but must switch back on in sequence.

“In order to put 100 cold houses on, we have to take off 200 because of the power load that is required,” observed Strickland.

That’s because as technology became more accessible, many homes have multiple televisions, computers and even large appliances, which all require power.

“We don’t really conserve our power much anymore,” said Strickland. “Now when people get their power back they want to turn up every heater in the house, and turn on every light, and everybody has two and three refrigerators, two or three deep fridges and things like that.”

If the houses are brought on too fast after an outage, it can crash the entire system, which Strickland says happened in the last outage. The hospital remains the number one priority for power restoration. The second priority for power restoration is the town’s water supply, followed by the seniors homes and the fuel suppliers, and the communications tower.

“It is unfortunate that some parts of town have to go a little bit longer without power,” noted Strickland, who hopes that new technology and infrastructure will help moving forward.

He also believes that it will help now that there is now a new NL Power regional manager in place to deal with matters, after the previous manager moved on to another position.

      body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – If you struggle with giving something up for Lent each year, you’re not alone. Reverend George Critchell says he struggles too.


“Normally I give up something for Lent and that’s not always that easy to do. Most people get half way through it, or they’re a quarter way through it and they throw it all down,” says Critchell. “I usually try to give up chocolate but I don’t very often succeed. I always yield to temptation when it comes to chocolate.”


Rather than do without and fall by the wayside, Critchell came up with a Food Bank challenge instead. Instead of fasting or doing without chocolate or any treat, he has challenged himself and everyone he knows to place one food item in a box every day for 40 days. At the end of the 40 days, the boxes are to be donated to the local Food Bank. This way there’s also a sense of accomplishment for those participating.


“This is not something that’s going to try anybody other than trying to remember to drop your food item in, so I thought well maybe that’s a good thing to do.”


Lt. Maurice Collins with the Salvation Army, which administers the region’s food bank, found out about the challenge through social media.


“I think it is wonderful. It is great to see the kindness of this coast,” says Collins.


Collins also admitted that demand for the area’s food bank remains higher than normal.


“We are seeing people who have been laid off because of the level 5 lockdown,” admits Collins. “Demand has been high this week.”


Currently the Salvation Army’s Food Bank is available by appointment only on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 9:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Anyone wishing to contact the Food Bank are asked to call (709) 695-7153.


Critchell says the demand for extra help is everywhere these days. But thankfully the challenge appears to be catching on elsewhere around the province too.


Although he hails from this region and was here for a short visit recently, Rev. Critchell is actively ministering in Baie Verte. The large food bank there is community run, rather than through a church or the Salvation Army, and Critchell says the community immediately jumped on board.


“I was talking to the people back there. They all have it started too,” says Critchell. “I expect they will do quite well.”


Even some of Critchell’s contacts outside of Newfoundland are signing on to the #FoodBankChallenge.


“It’s going over very, very well I must say. Actually I’ve even noticed some of names of people I know in Ontario who have started,” says Critchell. “This is one way we can help everybody and not have to really hurt ourselves to do it.”


Collins says the Port aux Basques food bank is currently running quite low on teabags, canned milk, sugar and canned soups, particularly tomato and vegetable soups. Anyone wishing to drop off food items to help out can ring the doorbell on Tuesday or Thursday morning to have their donations collected.",

      body: "About 90 per cent of Canadians live within 100 miles of the U.S. border. The Quebec City-Windsor corridor is the most densely populated and industrialized region of Canada with more than 18 million people. Why? Well it’s basically because of a warmer climate, more arable land, and modes of transportation and proximity to the world’s largest economy, the United States.


In Newfoundland, the best agricultural land is on the Southwest coast at Codroy Valley and the Three Rivers Area (Robinsons), and it also has the warmest climate. Coincidentally, this locale has the Gulf ferry service at Port-aux-Basques. And just offshore, through the Cabot Strait, commercial shipping from the very centre of North America via the St. Lawrence Seaway makes its way to all points of the Atlantic Ocean.


Overhead, contrails follow commercial and military aircraft as they wing their way from the Eastern U.S.A. and Canada to Europe and beyond. Everything necessary: warm climate, arable terrain sloping from the Appalachian Mountains to the ocean, and at the hub of Atlantic Canada’s transportation network are all closest in Newfoundland and Labrador to North American’s biggest economy including market and supply. And so, where is the population?


Well, it’s ‘Wagons East’ folks, and remember, transportation costs directly affect the price of goods. When systems are efficient and positive, the effects are better accessibility to markets, with employment, social and environmental benefits. Here we are, 700 km away from the East coast with over half of the population there, the Avalon Peninsula and the most easterly metro area on the continent at St. John’s.


In the spring and summer, the Labrador Current encircles the Avalon with partly Arctic water and sea ice, keeping the water temperature colder and delaying the growing season until late May. Prevailing westerly winds are higher in winter than in summer, making Newfoundland the windiest province in Canada. St. John’s is the windiest city in the country. It is also the foggiest, wettest, cloudiest with most episodes of freezing rain.


The arrangement puts more of our population increasingly farther from Canada’s market and supply. Most of the health care, higher education, government and commercial infrastructure is concentrated in a city with the most adverse weather in the Dominion, all surrounded by barren, irregular and rough topography.


Memorial University states that it nurtures new ideas and knowledge. There must be someone among the media, boards and chambers of business, government and political representatives who will step up to the plate and address this obvious sad state of affairs.

NHL Noise

I love a hockey rivalry. I’d blame it on being the youngest of 10 children, but judging from what I see on social media, you didn’t have to grow up in Old Mother Hubbard’s house to embrace heartfelt hatred for a competitor.

I was reared on the Battle of Quebec. The playoff meetings. The Stastny brothers. The Good Friday Massacre. If the Habs versus the Nordiques couldn’t get your blood pumping, you probably needed a date with the undertaker.  

A few summers ago, I spent a night at the Stastny Hotel and Golf Club in Saint-Nicolas. It crossed my mind that it might be connected to the brothers, but I didn’t really give it much thought. Then there I was, at the registration desk, in front of Marian Stastny.

For a minute, I was starstruck. I was 10 years old again. One-third of one of the iconic lines of my childhood was in front of me.

Then I noticed it. A picture of the brothers. With Guy Lafleur, my favourite Habs player… and he was not in a Habs jersey. I went from starstruck to teeth-grinding in about two seconds flat.

That’s what a rivalry will do to you.

The 2020-21 NHL season will be memorable – the shortened season, the taxi squad, the constant testing. It will also be remembered for new divisions and a baseball-style schedule, and the rivalries that were revived.  


Habs – Leafs

There was never any love lost between the Montreal Canadiens and the Toronto Maple Leafs. But this year both teams are good, and they’re also playoff bound. They’ll likely meet in the playoffs, but first they’ll meet for nine regular season games. As Tyler Toffoli noted, every game has a playoff atmosphere. 

Whether they’re playing each other or not, Habs and Leafs fans will be exchanging digs.

Who was worse against the Sens? Who had what pajamas as kids? Which free agents want to play where?

If you live in certain parts of the country, those jabs can happen around the dinner table. 


The Battle of Alberta

The Edmonton Oilers and the Calgary Flames will fight for a playoff spot in the North. Both teams ice a skilled group, but they also each have pests.

Zack Kassian and Matthew Tkachuk could find trouble at a church choir practice, so there’s no surprise there has been some memorable strife between the two. Multiple encounters is just what this bromance needed. 


The Battle of Pennsylvania

This rivalry dates back to 1967 when the NHL expanded beyond six teams and added the Philadelphia Flyers and the Pittsburgh Penguins. It peaked in the 90s when Eric Lindros and Mario Lemieux faced off.

The rivalry has been renewed this season due to a little front-office drama. Ron Hextall, the Flyers goaltender during the height of the rivalry, has recently been named the General Manager of the Penguins.


Raptors Racket

With the calendar winding down to the March 25th trade deadline, the NBA rumour mill is heating up. Last week, a rumour circulated that the Raptors were working on a trade that would bring in Andre Drummond from the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Raptors are currently sitting in 7th place in the Eastern conference, which would qualify them for the NBA play-in process between the 7th to 10th place teams in each conference. Not exactly a sure bet, but can management ignore the holes on this team and hope for the best? Stay tuned.

      body: "In his debut novel, Degrees of Guilt, author Jim Bennett takes readers on a roller-coaster of emotions, twists and turns, and unexpected outcomes.


In the prologue, Bennett dangles the hook by introducing us to “Uncle Billy”, who seems to be deep in the throes of PTSD. Billy shoots down a helicopter buzzing a sealing boat and in the process kills everyone aboard the chopper.


As the novel opens, we meet a shady character named Glenn Holmes who, after being expelled from the USA for drug dealing, simply relocates his criminal enterprises to the University of Toronto. Holmes is a busy dealer and loan shark, and ends up with dismal marks which will mean no college will admit him unless he does something about it. 


His answer is to switch his transcripts with that of an A-level student and soon finds himself at a prestigious Halifax institution, after which he manages to ingratiate himself with the Green Earth Society. He sells them on the idea of a documentary about the seal hunt and then he sells the idea to journalists and a fading porn star, collecting huge fees from them to join in the endeavour.


Only once these chess pieces are in place do we meet the protagonist Billy Wheeler, who is the fourth boy of a fishing family from the North coast of Newfoundland. Wheeler soon realizes that there is not much future for him with the dying fishery, so he enrolls in the Canadian Armed forces.


Since Canada is not at war he doesn’t expect to see combat. However, his unit is soon deployed to a peace keeping mission in the Balkans where he is witness to untold horrors. While he is away on deployment, his wife has a miscarriage. After the horror of the Balkans, Wheeler is re-deployed to the Middle East where more combat offers more trauma and creates a lasting, indelible effect in his mind.


Upon his return home, Wheeler’s skill with a rifle is put to use by his own family and he begins shooting seals. Finally all of the story lines converge. Billy, aboard the fishing boat where he’s hunting seals, shoots down the helicopter with Glenn aboard and the former soldier is eventually charged with murder.


The court scenes that follow are detailed and follow the Canadian legal code, much the way that John Grisham so brilliantly crafts American court scenes. The prosecutor and the defense attorney are quite interesting in their own right as they parry and thrust with Wheeler’s life and justice for the victims hanging in the balance. This setting is further compounded when the defense attorney falls for Billy, a development that threatens to derail her strategy.


The outcome is as unexpected as it is satisfying.


Whether one is a proponent or an opponent of the seal hunt, this is a must read. It also serves as a very realistic glimpse into life in the numerous outports of Newfoundland.

NHL Noise

We’re deep enough in the NHL season that teams are figuring out who they are and if they’re meeting expectations. About now, fans and pundits start talking about job security and who might be on the chopping block from teams that are struggling.


After 23 games last season the Maple Leafs decided Mike Babcock’s time was up. Pro-rated to this season’s schedule, that’s about 16 games. That’s about where we are now in the shortened season.


The COVID-19 climate is not ideal for shuffling staff. Perhaps you could find more job security if you worked for Skip the Dishes or Amazon, but not much. Nevertheless, if you suck like a Hoover there will be consequences, and this week there were consequences in Montreal.


On Wednesday, Feb. 24, Head Coach Claude Julien and Associate Coach Kirk Muller were relieved of their duties.


GM Marc Bergevin had a very busy off-season. He saw enough progress from his kids “in the bubble” that he was ready to invest to build around them. After adding major parts that included an elite back-up goalie and two top-6 forwards, Bergie was ready to pronounce his team playoff ready. Julien and Muller were excited about their bolstered roster. I think the smart kids call that foreshadowing.


After getting off to a 7-1-2 start the Habs faltered, going 2-4-2 in their last 8 games. But here’s the kicker. The losses were uglier than a monkey’s armpit.


The penalty kill was suffering, a poorly timed quandary while taking undisciplined penalties by the wholesale. Power play meant momentum killer.


Their two-on-one strategy was a face plant. I could go on, but you get the picture. It was a mess, and solutions were harder to find than a squid’s ankle. How did things go so foul so fast? Well, that’s the stuff that theories are made of.


Captain Shea Weber talked about a negative energy around the team. Young centre Nick Suzuki spoke of playing not to lose instead of playing to win. The infusion of new talent meant some regulars lost prominent roles, and disenchantment was growing.

Heck, fans were talking about banning the reverse retro jersey. 


When the Habs lost to the Ottawa Senators on Tuesday night (Feb. 23) for the third time in four meetings, Bergie had seen enough. By the time you stopped pressing snooze on your alarm clock Wednesday morning and climbed out of bed, he was already freeing up futures. 

Dominique Ducharme is the new Head Coach, promoted from the assistant role. He has a new assistant in Alexandre Burrows, promoted from the farm in Laval. Luke Richardson continues in his role.


By the time you’re reading this, we will already have seen two games under the new leadership. Ducharme has an enormous task ahead of him taking over a team that was built for another guy’s system, but it feels like a brand-new season in Habsland.

 

Raptors Racket

Don’t look now, but the Toronto Raptors have climbed their way back to .500 and are in fifth place in the NBA’s Eastern Conference. The March 25th trade deadline is swiftly approaching and there are decisions to be made. 


If the conversation were only about filling holes, the obvious need in Toronto is for size up front. The Raptors will need to upgrade the centre position to make any serious post-season noise. Mo Bamba from the Orlando Magic has been rumoured as one potential target.


But the bigger decision is what to do with pending unrestricted free agent Kyle Lowry. Lowry is in his ninths season as an important fixture in Toronto, and it seems unlikely that he’d be moved if the Raps remain in playoff contention. But he’s also an interesting trade chip, and the potential return could speed up a reset focused on a younger core of Fred VanVleet, OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam. 


We’ll keep an eye on how this one bounces.




Blue Jays Babble

      body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – It’s Monday night, Feb. 22 and the transport trailers are slowly rolling, one by one, into the parking lot of the shuttered Visitor Information Centre. Waiting for them to come to a complete stop, a small group of Salvation Army volunteers is huddled safely against the bitter winds of winter and COVID-19, wearing warm hats, gloves, face masks and shields.


Overseeing the operation is Maurice Collins. It’s not the first time he and his little group of Salvation Army volunteers have stepped in to help transport drivers. They say they are just doing their part by offering up a free, hot meal and a friendly word or two to the truckers who continue to serve the province, bringing in food, medication and other essentials.

The Salvation Army has provided this service before, and Collins says they were ready and happy to help out when asked once again.


“The call came from Andrew Parsons, through John Haggie,” says Collins. “That came down Thursday night (Feb. 18).”


There are 10 volunteers on the team tonight, including Melva and Bert Osmond and Darlene Collier. Port aux Basques Mayor John Spencer is a certified flag person and busy directing truckers in off the highway.


Those who aren’t working the lot are busy over at the Salvation Army’s commercial kitchen, cooking up the roast turkey breast and vegetables and prepping the plates. It then gets brought over the food truck, which drove up from St. John’s on Saturday. It keeps the meals fresh until they are served. The food is filling and hot, and appears to be deeply appreciated.

Doug Spence rolls up in huge white Clarke’s truck, and a volunteer stretches up to quickly hand him supper through the open driver’s window. He’s bound for Corner Brook tonight, headed back now that the ferry is cancelled, and he heard at Tim Horton’s this morning that the hot meal service was starting up again. He used to partake regularly last time around too.


“It was very, very convenient. We really enjoyed it. We appreciated it, because it was hard to get hot meals anywhere for truckers,” he shouts above the wind and the roar of his engine.

Spence, who has been driving for just over five years, is one of about 40 drivers the Salvation Army feeds this night. The last time around, they usually saw between 50 to 60 drivers, but tonight the boat isn’t sailing because of the storm so the number is down a bit.


“Some of them said ‘Oh so glad to see you back’. They’re really appreciative that we’re there,” says Collins.


Collins also notes that residents of the Southwest coast have also jumped in to help out via donations, but the Salvation Army is operating as part of the province’s emergency disaster plan. Feeding the truckers is a joint effort between the provincial government, Marine Atlantic and the Salvation Army.


Around noon, Collins gets a text advising him how many vehicles are crossing. Past experience means he can usually predict quite well how many guests to expect for supper. The traffic tends to be a bit lighter on the weekends.


“It’s not a guess anymore. It’s education,” says Collins.


Meals are usually served between 6:30 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., though they tweak as necessary. Depending on the weather, the ferry might be a bit late or a bit early. It doesn’t matter. They’ll stay out until the last trucker is fed.


He’s not sure if Marine Atlantic still announces the service to drivers during the crossing, but Collins is a member of the Newfoundland Truckers page on Facebook and posted to get the word out. The last time he checked the post had well over 1,200 shares and 8,000 views.

The volunteers may have to brave more blustery nights for a while yet, likely at least until the lockdown lifts and the restaurants re-open.


“Until the government tells us we’re not needed. We’re here to do whatever we can for the truckers. They are our lifeline, and not being able to get hot meals is definitely of concern, and we need to make sure that they’re taken care of,” says Collins.",

      subtitles: "The smaller redfish of the two shown above is 23 cm in length. FFAW-Unifor says 70 percent of the Unit 1 redfish being landed are larger than the 22 cm minimum. - FFAW-Unifor",
      body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – On Jan. 25, FISH-NL President Ryan Cleary posted a couple of photos to the group page on Facebook. The photos showed a blue cigarette lighter next to some palm sized redfish that had been landed at the dock in Port aux Basques.


“Concern on the wharf is that the vast majority of the experimental redfish quota being caught lately in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (like this fish landed this week in Port aux Basques) is too small to be used for anything other than bait or offal,” read Cleary’s post.


“I was contacted last week by some inshore fishermen on the West Coast and they were concerned because recent landing of redfish in Port aux Basques were small,” he said during a phone interview not long after putting up the post. “There’s an experimental fishery for redfish in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.”


Cleary maintained that the redfish being landed were consistently small or even undersized, which he says represents a danger to the future of the entire stock. The regulation size for a redfish is 22 cm,


“We’ve fished other stocks to extinction. You’d think we would have learned from what happened,” said Cleary. “But we haven’t learned.”


While the images are striking, Fish, Food and Allied Workers Union (FFAW-Unifor) data shows that 70 per cent of Unit 1 redfish were larger than the 22 cm minimum. Responding via e-mail, Courtney Langille, Communications Officer for FFAW-Unifor agreed that this is smaller than the ideal size for a commercial fishery.


“Redfish are currently between 22 and 25 cm in fork length,” wrote Langille. “It will take time to develop and demonstrate solutions to expected challenges to a new redfish fishery in the Gulf. We need to figure out how to target the more abundant species, how to not catch other groundfish and avoid catching small redfish. If we waited until the fish reach a larger size we would not have time to figure out solutions.”


Redfish are a slow-growing species, and the experimental fishery is hoping to figure out a way to fish them sustainably to support fisheries and communities for decades. That would mean jobs for harvesters, onshore processing workers and spin offs within smaller communities.


“It is well-known that the inshore fishery and onshore processing is the lifeblood of coastal Newfoundland and Labrador. The value of inshore fleets and onshore processing to our coastal communities is one of the reasons we are working hard to ensure there is a sustainable and profitable redfish fishery in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Before the redfish fishery collapsed in the 1990s, it supported onshore processing in communities on Newfoundland’s South and West Coasts,” wrote Langille. “The species of redfish we want to target is called mentella. The ongoing experimental test fishery gives us a chance get this fishery off on the right foot. It will be a few years before we may see a commercial redfish fishery, but with fish harvesters as stewards of our resource, we’re determined to do it right.


Because of sheer size of the biomass estimated in the Gulf, FFAW-Unifor is confident that the experimental fishery will not have any negative impact on the stock.


“The last assessment estimated 3,044,000 tonnes of commercial-sized redfish of Sebastes mentella (deepwater redfish) alone,” responded Langille.


Experimental fisheries landings from around Newfoundland were less than 500 tonnes in 2019, off an estimated biomass level of more than 3,044,000 tonnes of deepwater redfish that reached the 22 cm minimum threshold and Atlantic or Acadian redfish that exceeded the minimum harvest size.


FFAW-Unifor data reports that redfish biomass continues to grow and dominate the Gulf of St. Lawrence finfish biomass. The Sebastes mentella trawlable biomass was estimated to be 4,365,000 tonnes in 2019, which puts it at the highest level since the 1980s.


“It is a once-in-a-lifetime fishery development opportunity but there are still considerable challenges in building this sustainable, profitable, and long-term fishery,” wrote Langille.


In the 4R3Pn zone, FFAW and the NL groundfish otter trawl fleet are focused on experimental fishing to find ways to target the more abundant redfish species (mentella), minimize bycatch and harm to groundfish like Atlantic halibut, and fish more sustainably overall. Last year fishing was done a modified bottom trawl and a standard groundfish bottom trawl side-by-side.


“The modified trawl was fished with semi-pelagic doors and the result was that the redfish catch rates were as good as – and at times better than – the standard trawl. Redfish catch rates were on average 1.8 t/h, which is comparable to commercial catch rates in the 1980s. This means there is no decrease in commercial catch rates from fishing with the semi-pelagic doors – and minimizing trawling impacts on the bottom.”


In January 2020, one midwater set recorded 4000 tonnes in less than a half hour of fishing. The results varied, but FFAW-Unifor was encouraged because that represented a major improvement over the 2018 and 2019 midwater trial rates, which had been quite low.


“Troy Genge, the captain of the Guardian Gale, reported that when they fished the midwater trawl there was very little bycatch and that when you looked back on the deck, it was all redfish,” noted Langille.


“Our work has demonstrated that information collected from onboard commercial fishing vessels can be used to determine where, when, and at what depth, fish harvesters can target the more abundant redfish species. These results and continued research will help guide the foundation of a sustainable and profitable redfish fishery and protect existing fisheries in the Gulf.”


Before the redfish fishery collapsed in the 1990s, it helped support onshore processing jobs along the Southwest Coast. FFAW-Unifor says that is one of the reasons it is focused on ensuring there is a sustainable and profitable redfish fishery in the future. Historically, the redfish fishery meant onshore processing jobs for about 5 months of the year.


“Redfish is a lesser-known species, but it meant a lot to our communities in the 80’s and 90’s for fishermen and plant workers alike. Similar to cod, a new redfish fishery will look very different than it did three decades ago. Using sustainable methods to reduce our levels of bycatch and undersize fish we have a unique opportunity here to build a sustainable fishery from the ground up.”


But as it works to build the future of redfish into a long-term sustainable fishery, FFAW-Unifor must ensure that measures are in place to protect existing high-value fisheries such as the longline Atlantic halibut fishery in 4R and 3Pn – a high-value sustainable fishery with over 500 small boat enterprises, and the Gulf shrimp fishery, which had a quota of just over 8.5 million pounds for 4R in 2020.


FFAW-Unifor stated that its ongoing work is currently focused on understanding the behavioural differences among bycatch species, understanding if redfish catch rates from midwater trawl are comparable to bottom trawl outside of the winter fishing season before investments are made in midwater gear, protection of the existing sustainable and high-value halibut longline fisheries - more information needed on post-release survival) because the trialed bottom contact gears did not result in decreases of this bycatch, and a broader understanding of ground fish species distributions and of fish harvester targeting behaviour to detail seasonal, regional or depth-related opportunities to minimize unwanted bycatch.


Concluded Langille, “If we are able to rebuild a sustainable redfish fishery, the benefits will extend well beyond the wharf to coastal communities and municipalities.”

      body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – “It’s amazing how many local people haven’t been there,” says Scott Strickland. ‘There’ is Channel Head, a large outcropping of rock at the mouth of the Port aux Basques harbour and home to the town’s historic lighthouse.


Strickland is one of four active members on the Channel Head Heritage Lighthouse Committee and manages its Facebook page. 


The lighthouse has overlooked the harbour for well over 100 years, greeting ferry passengers or bidding them farewell, and guiding all watercraft in and out of the Southwest Coast. The fully automated white clad lighthouse and outbuildings remains accessible only via boat.


Last summer, the Lighthouse Committee installed a series of storyboards on the island itself and rebuilt the boardwalk up to the lighttower, but there weren’t many tourists or even locals around to notice. 


The boards are weatherproofed and are designed to be left out year round. They highlight the history and the daily life on the island, and Strickland hopes they will last a few years.

“We had other plans in development as well, but covid has certainly hampered things,” admits Strickland.


Since 2020 was supposed to be Come Home Year the committee came up with a few other plans as well, but thanks to the pandemic that all got canceled.


“We were hoping to do at least one major day/event on the island, plus promotional items as well.”


Not among the committee’s plans was a zipline, a rumour that made the rounds around the community at one point and even got a brief mention during at least one Town council meeting. 


“Not sure where the whole zipline thing came from. It was not our idea and would have been turned down by our committee. Glad that one didn’t pass.”


Strickland says that any future plans for the lighthouse are a bit more reserved.


“We’re looking at more of a historical preservation standpoint with staffless tourism features, just so people can get a sense of the history of the island when they visit.”


Built in 1874 and 1875, the lighthouse has been recognized as a Federal Heritage structure by Parks Canada.


According to the Parks Directory, “The Lighttower is associated with the importance of the fishery and maritime trade to Newfoundland. The Lighttower was part of a larger effort to ensure safe trans-Atlantic travel through the Straits of Belle Isle, as well as a marker for local traffic using the harbour at Port aux Basques. Its construction marked the beginning of the evolution of local communities from small isolated outposts to their eventual status as an integrated settlement serving as a rail and ferry terminus as well as a fishing post. It remains a major light on this coast.”


Strickland is among those disappointed by the unavoidable postponement of Come Home Year. 


“We were hoping to do at least one major day/event on the island, plus promotional items as well.”


Strickland expects that once the proverbial COVID dust settles down, the committee will actively recruit new members to help forge new plans and ideas to help preserve the town’s historic site. In the meantime, the Channel Head page offers a glimpse into its history, including pictures, artwork and details about the lighthouse keepers who ensured friends and neighbours made it home safely.",

      body: "Hello! Welcome to my first history column for the Wreckhouse Weekly!


My name is Melissa Samms. I attended Bélanger Memorial from 1995-2008. Back then I had no interest in learning about history – I had such a hard time memorizing dates and names! 


Then I met history students while attending Memorial University (MUN), where I took a few history courses and had a fascinating ride in perspective. The most important thing I feel that I learned was that the study of history isn’t always about specifics (although they can be fun). 

Rather it’s about understanding the cause and effect of time up to our lives today. It’s true, though, that as you learn more about history your perspective widens.


Our region of Newfoundland and Labrador has an extremely long and complex history that has been shaped by world events over centuries and millennia. Our colonial history goes back hundreds of years, and our indigenous roots are thousands of years deep. Our lens of history and time is wide, and I feel like the hours and hours of research I’ve already done is just a drop in the bucket.


Over most of 2020 I worked on contracts for the Southwest Coast Historical Society, researching and writing articles about local history. 


I jumped headfirst into research, trawling MUN’s Digital Archive Initiative (collections.mun.ca), looking at old newspapers, reading books with any mention of our communities’ names, checking old magazines and journals, and trying to find the start of written records for the region. That meant a lot of colonial and European encyclopedias, navigational books, dry government reports, and many charts and maps.


It goes back far b’ys. Like, real far. Potentially over 1000 years far.


The earliest records I can find so far are Basque. Later came the French, then much later Scots dropped in, followed by the English, especially Channel Islanders. We’re a remarkably diverse area where not too long ago four languages were commonly spoken –English, French, Scots Gaelic, and Mi’kmaq.


With such a colourful past, I’ll have a lot to share with my fellow history fans and readers. Some topics I want to touch on are language and communication, religion, economics, colonialism, Wabna’kik, Mi’kma’ki, our education development, and more.

We have a lot to be proud of here on the Southwest Coast. Let’s talk about it!",

      subtitles: "Gerard Gale is the next generation who will eventually take over the family’s 128-year-old grocery and convenience store from his father, E. W. ‘Hockey’ Gale (right). - SUBMITTED",
      body: "MILLVILLE – If you could pick one thing that seems to be constant in the Codroy Valley, it would be either bad roads, great views, or Hockey Gale’s. The store has been there longer than you might think, and it seems it will be there for a lot longer yet. 


Edwin “Hockey” Gale is the current owner and namesake of the venerable mainstay, and he remembers a lot about the history of the shop. 


“My grandfather, Alex Gale, started it way back. I’m told it was 1893, but I can't be sure,” says Hockey. “Anyway, he was a fisherman – they were all fishermen back then – and he moved in from the coast, from places like Net Cove and Capelin Cove. They moved in here and he started a carding mill and a small general store.” 


If you don’t know what a carding mill is either, then don’t worry. Hockey knows all about that too. 


“A carding mill is where they card (disentangle) the sheep’s wool. That building is actually still right next door to the store, and we still call it the mill of course, and there’s still some equipment in there from when they carded the wool. The wool used to get sent in here from everywhere, 24 hours a day, from all over Newfoundland, PEI, Nova Scotia, everywhere.”


The carding mill was a busy spot right up until the late 40s, and eventually shuttered its doors in the early 50s when yarn became easier to process. But the general store kept on going. 


Shortly after the carding mill opened over 125 years ago, Alex opened a small general store right beside it. 


“Everything was barter back then of course, trade and whatnot,” explains Hockey. “There wasn’t a lot of cash on the go I don’t think.”


His grandfather was married three times, and as Hockey recalls it, all 16 of his children worked in the carding mill at one point or another. 


“My father was the youngest of all the eight boys, so I guess that’s why he’s the one who took over the store,” says Hockey. 


Wallace Gale, Hockey’s father, stepped down in 1980, after running the general store for about forty years. He was the second Gale man to have control of the family shop, in what appears to have organically become a tradition of passing the store from one generation to the next. Hockey’s youngest son, Gerard, is the next in line to take over the store. He has already begun to make some changes, and is learning just how much is involved in keeping the old place running. 


“I actually just moved home about 5 months ago, from Halifax,” says Gerard.


With a background in advertising, Gerard figures that he should be able to institute a number of modernizations to Hockey’s, but the name wont be one of them. 


“We aren’t changing the name,” he laughs. “It’s going to stay Hockey’s.”


But it hasn’t always been known as that either. What was built by Alex in 1893 was known as Millville Stores. Once Wallace took over, at about the age of about 27, he phased out the carding mill gradually, and actually tore the whole store down in 1960. It was moved next to the highway, where a couple of stores are currently in operation. 


“Dad built the store over there on the highway in 1956 and sold cars until 1969,” recalls Hockey. 


“He sold that store then, and was going to retire, and there was a little store here, right exactly where the old store was, so he bought that in 1970. It was a small, tiny little store, and we’ve been picking at it ever since.” 


Indeed, Gales isn’t such a tiny place anymore. The now sprawling general store has gone through numerous changes, renovations, and upgrades for the past 50 years. 


“I started there when I was 15, you know, after school, and I’m just kind of getting out of it a little bit now,” offers Hockey.


When Wall, as Wallace was known, purchased the confectionery store in 1970, he renamed the shop to Wallace J. Gale and Son. 


“I was the son,” laughs Hockey. “And then in 1980 we changed it to E.W. Gale Ltd.”


The nickname that Edwin Wallace Joseph Gale has carried with him his whole life has very little to do with the sport, and more to do with his demeanor as a young lad. He laughs heartily at the memory of getting saddled with the moniker. 


“My father used to call me Hack, because I used to cry a good bit when I was really small, and my sister turned it into Hockey, probably cause of her accent. And it stuck ever since.” 


From 1980 onward, the store has been known throughout the Codroy Valley and the entire Southwest Coast region simply as Hockey’s. He has run it successfully for the better part of 40 years, much like his father and his grandfather before him. 


Hockey’s goal was to become a broad grocery store, branching out into hardware and tools. He accomplished that and more, even selling snowmobiles in the shop for 13 years. But one of the most famous incidents in Gale’s history had nothing to do with sales. 


“I had Dan in there one time,” laughs Hockey. “Dan was my big old Clydesdale. He was so gentle though, just amazing.”


Hockey admits to a rough and rowdy streak back in his day, and that prompted him to bring the enormous horse into his store. He says the prank was purely, “For badness...just brought him in to scare the girls!”


At 29, Gerard is thus far showing little evidence he possesses that little streak of badness his father once had. A friendly, sociable man, he says he got the idea last year to, “Leave the big city behind, and move back to see what this life had to offer.”


He hadn’t really considered taking over the store until his father was interviewed last year by CBC about the old mill, when Hockey said the store would likely end with him. 


“Yeah, I just asked Mom and Dad if they’d be interested in passing the store along, and how would we could go about that, and they were super psyched.”


Gerard looks around and sums up his impression of the store.


“A little bit of everything. I mean, when you’re a general store in rural Newfoundland, you kind of have to have a little bit of everything to suit everyone’s needs.”


He admits it’s a steep learning curve, but concedes that having his father so handy to step in with advice borne from decades of experience is a great help.


“There’s a lot of things for me to learn, since I’ve moved home, like so much, but in terms of actual performance of the store, I think having a little injection of new life is going to go a long way.”


What changes he foresees won’t detract at all from his father’s legacy either. If anything, he hopes to bring it more to the forefront.


“I don’t want to do a complete overhaul, and lose the charm thats been brewing forever,” says Gerard. 


“The name of the store, people around here call it Hockey’s, and I love that it came from the community. So we are sort of adopting it, and I’ve come up with a logo, hats, shirts, stickers, and I just think it’s such a good way to lean into the Hockey name.”


But it’s only natural that he does want to tweak some things. He’s already made his mark on the venerable shop, bringing in fresh produce and replacing the old open panel coolers that had been in use since the mid 80s.


“We got rid of it because they weren’t working great, and it was a bit of an eyesore, so I brought in those three coolers, and I think that was the biggest indicator of change.”


He aims to lean more heavily into fresh foods, such as avocados, asparagus, and other regional goods.


“We plan on sourcing local for sure.” 


They currently sell coffee from a local roastery, made right next door in fact, as well as locally made soaps, and these are already proving to be a hit with customers. 


“I think that’s the way we need to go,” says Gerard. “Kind of become a celebration of the community, and I think that’s one way we can stay relevant and compete.”


Gerard relies heavily on the staff of the store, some of whom have been there for around 30 years.


“For me to just come in and call myself the manager, versus those ladies who know so much, I’m still learning. They know way more than I do. But I can come in and make tweaks, with the aesthetics, sort of the look of the store, I can make those changes.”


After about 128 years of Gale’s store, with each of the previous owners running the place for roughly 40 years, it seems like Gerard will have plenty of time to learn the ropes and pave the way for the next generation to follow.",

I have a lot of those, but one of the ones that makes me laugh is running down to the old East End Channel store when I was 5 or 6 years old, and filling my cheeks with those yellow banana candies or those little ice creams that came in the plastic cone, with the frozen gumball in the bottom. I could eat 10 of those a day I think. 


We called it Spencer’s back then, some 40 plus years ago, but like so much, it’s now just a memory. The convenience of convenience stores is easy to miss, especially where I live in way down in Channel.


My mother still remembers all the old stores – Mrs. Colley’s, Windsor’s, Sheila Ford’s, Mrs. Moyses and Roy Spencer’s. That’s five stores all in one little area and now there’s none. 

When I went to the old St. James Elementary, I remember there used to be a little shop just at the bottom of Elizabeth Street, where we used to sprint down at recess and grab as many penny candies as our grubby little hands could carry. I recall the old RCMP station on that street too, where I took my first bicycle to get a serial number engraved in it. 


I don’t mention old locations just to wander down memory lane.


Another business is leaving the downtown area, settling into a bigger and better location. It will have the definite advantage of being more visible, and certainly more central in town, but I cant help but feel that most of Port aux Basques seems to be migrating up the road. The elementary school, the new Stadium, the Town depot – all moved up the road. 


My sister and I run Wreckhouse Press from her home, just 20 paces from where I played as a boy. It’s likely just a matter of time until we also have to move up the road, into a bigger location with more centralized access to serve the public. 


And it's really a shame, because the East End of town is where I am from, where I work, and what I love most. I’m in no hurry to go too.",
