    subtitles: "Last week’s string of winter storms caused whiteouts along the Southwest Coast, prompted accidents and stranded vehicles. Cpl. Colin Helm of the Port aux Basques detachment of the RCMP has some tips about how to prepare your vehicle in case of an emergency. - RENE J. ROY / WRECKHOUSE PRESS",
    body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – With the entertaining weather that walloped our region last week, there were a number of accidents reported throughout the southwest coast on Tuesday, Mar. 2 and Wednesday, Mar. 3. 


According to Corporal Colin Helm of the Port aux Basques RCMP detachment, last Tuesday night, “There were two calls for service. A tractor-trailer rolled over in the Wreckhouse at approximately 10:30 p.m., and a vehicle was stranded on the side of the road, around the Barachois Hill area. That call came in at about 1 o’clock (a.m.).“


Fortunately neither of those incidents resulted in more than a few minor cuts and scrapes to the truck driver, but it could have been a great deal worse.  The RCMP attempted to reach the stranded driver, who had posted updates of her ordeal on Facebook, but they soon found themselves in a precarious situation as well. 


Said Helm, “On our way to the call, the police cruiser was put off the road, due to high winds, and very poor visibility. It was next to no visibility once we left the detachment.”


Due to the extreme weather, the decision was made to call off the rescue, as it was too dangerous to make another attempt. This forced the stranded motorist to spend the night in her vehicle until approximately 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday until help could reach her. Helm stresses just how important it is for drivers to be aware of the conditions they drive in, and how being prepared can make the difference between life and death. 


“I would like the public to be aware that driving in these types of conditions is not recommended. However, if the driver chooses to drive in these conditions, then they need to be prepared.”


He goes on to emphasize the importance of being aware of deteriorating road conditions during the height of storms. 


“In incidences such as this incident, there may be times where first responders cannot get to you, and therefore you need to be prepared.”


Specifically, Helm points to the benefit of vehicle emergency kits. 


Motorists can buy a winter emergency kit pretty much anywhere these days, but it’s also easy and more affordable to build one. Store bought survival kits come equipped with a range of items but most include road flares, whistles, hot packs, a small shovel, and can be bought for as little as $30 or even all the way up to $300 kits. 


“The RCMP highly recommends emergency preparedness kits,” says Helm. “They can be purchased at stores or online.”


Some readily available and inexpensive items can save your life if you have them on hand in an emergency, should the need arise. 


“A shovel is recommended, and candles, for heat in the event you run out of gas. With that being said, I would also recommend the driver always have a full tank of gas before leaving.”


When the gas runs out, so does the heat.


“You would be exposed to the elements,” says Helm. “One candle, if you can get one of those jar type candles, one of those can provide you with enough heat to keep you cozy enough to stay warm for hours.”


He also has some advice that isn’t quite as often thought of, like properly clearing the exhaust pipe of debris or snow. 


“Make sure you clear it of anything that can block it, which would prevent carbon monoxide buildup inside of the car”.


If you’re thinking of building your own kit, Helm recommends including additional items.


“Blankets, definitely food provisions like granola bars, or something small, something that wont spoil. Water or juices, even some extra clothing.” 


All RCMP vehicles are stocked with a full emergency preparedness kit, which Helm says can be built by a motorist for less money than purchasing one, since most items are already in the home. 


“The cheapest way is to build one yourself absolutely. You can just get a tote with a lid and build it from there.”


Helm says that he always asks motorists who have become stranded what their exact situation is, whether or not they have an emergency kit, and how much gas they have. Most of the time their answers denote a lack of preparation.


“It’s not something we often think of because we think, ‘Oh, I’m never going to be in that scenario’, but guess what? Sometimes you can be.”

    subtitles: "All firefighters, including those stationed with the Channel-Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department, are among those now deemed eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine under Phase Two of the provincial vaccination plan. - © FILE PHOTO",
    body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – With the first phase of vaccinations nearing completion, the provincial government has laid out plans for Phases Two and Three. Registration has already begun for those in Phase Two, with vaccinations expected to begin sometime in April. 


One of the groups identified in Phase Two is firefighters, both career and volunteer. For Todd Strickland, Assistant Fire Chief for the Channel-Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department, it’s welcome news. 


Strickland is also a front line worker in the Dr. Charles L. LeGrow Health Center. As such, he has already received his first shot of the vaccine. 


“I would encourage all firefighters to get the vaccine,” he states via an online interview, but adds, “I can’t say with certainty that all firefighters will take it.”


Strickland admits that with so many variables, and with the now three types of vaccines on the government approval lists, “I understand if firefighters are reluctant to receive it.”

Volunteer firefighter Josh Ingram has no hesitation whatsoever about choosing to get vaccinated. 


“Most definitely,” was his response as to whether or not he’d be booking a vaccination appointment.


Although Ingram admits to being a bit surprised that firefighters are included in Phase Two, he says he agrees with it wholeheartedly.


“We are indeed front line in an emergency situation.”


He also notes some concerns about side effects, but his priority is the safety and well being of those he comes into contact with, starting first and foremost with his loved ones.


“I do question some of the supposed long term effects, but I’m more concerned with the health and well being of my 6-year-old girl, and 7-month-old boy. There’s a lot of misinformation out there.”


Strickland agrees, and says that he is more than willing to help clear up any questions.


“I would speak to the firefighters about the efficiency and percentages put forward on the vaccines and/or direct them to places to research themselves to ensure they make informed decisions on the topic.”


Chief Jerry Musseau admits that the pandemic has been creating challenges for the department. 


“Until we are out of this lockdown we will not be doing any training or orientation with new members or any member at this time.” 


Musseau says that even though none of the members of the Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department has contracted the virus, there are contingency plans in place should an outbreak occur. 


“If this should happen we would have to follow the rules of the public health authority that are in place. If we end up in isolation due to a member testing positive, we have to rely on our outlying fire departments for backup in the event of an emergency. We do have mutual aid agreements in place with all the other (regional) fire departments.”


It remains unclear just when or how fire department, and others who qualify under Phase Two, will be able to get their vaccines.",

    body: "I’m getting tired, and I’m not talking about the pandemic, though God knows I’m sick of that too. No, I’m talking politics and the incessant B.S. that shows no sign of ending anytime soon.


People seem to think delaying an election that has been called is as easy as flipping off a light switch. A clue: it’s not. There are laws in this free country and free province for a reason. 


Meanwhile the media has delighted in hijacking COVID-19 briefings to focus on the election because ratings means money and they can get the pandemic stats easily enough from the daily press releases anyway.


On social media, conspiracy theorists seem to think that it somehow benefits provincial and federal leaders to keep the economy shut down and us all at home, sipping off the country’s teat instead of going out to earn during a global pandemic.


Former Premier and retired Chief Justice Clyde Wells recently gave a CBC Here & Now interview where he stated that in his opinion, Bruce Chaulk hasn’t overstepped in measures he has taken to adapt the election during the pandemic and recent outbreak that prompted another lockdown.


“Somebody may challenge it, but I don’t see how it could be successful on anything that I’ve seen to date,” said Wells.


None of it makes sense, and looking to provincial leaders for answers isn’t going to help because they’re too busy playing the blame game. Unlike Wells, I fully expect this election to get mired in a legal battle.


More time and taxpayer money will be wasted. Perhaps we’ll have a public inquiry that recommends changes that won’t solve anything. It’ll likely take years.


In the meantime, what are they doing to fix the provincial debt exactly? As a former postal employee I can promise you that Moya Greene is not going to provide salvation. Been there, done that.


Services are already gutted. Good luck getting help unless it’s online and that was the case well before the pandemic. Too bad the websites are so outdated and ineffective.

Who needs that on top of everything else?


What we’re going to get after this election is what we always get – promises, mostly broken. This is not a partisan opinion. I truly believe it doesn’t matter anymore who wins.

We’re going to get tax hikes and service cutbacks. Big business will continue to skyrocket prices unchecked, and we will pay it because they are not brought to heel. Heck, they don’t even pay municipal taxes most of the time. They know all of the loop holes.


What’s the solution? Heck if I know. I’m not a politician.


What is truly disturbing is that none of the parties really seem to know either. I’ve read their platforms and I’m not impressed with any of them, but if I don’t vote how does that help?

Here’s what I do know. We’re in a hole and we’re still digging. It’s time to pick up a shovel and fill it back in, instead of just hoping to supervise.",

    subtitles: "“I am constantly receiving questions and inquiries from all over the world regarding how we became autism friendly. - SUBMITTED",
    body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Joan Chaisson admits to being very surprised when she got a phone call from someone at the Governor General’s office in Ottawa.


“In fact, at first I thought it was someone calling with a prank call,” says Chaisson via e-mail interview. 


Chaisson is a co-founder of Autism Involves Me (AIM). She and co-founder April Billard, who formed the group in 2013, have been chosen to receive the Meritorious Service Medal (MSM) awarded by Rideau Hall on behalf of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II.


The MSM recognizes those who have made remarkable contributions in many fields of endeavour including advocacy, health care, research initiatives and humanitarian efforts. Their medals were awarded in the civil division of the decoration, which recognizes exceptional deeds accomplished over a limited period of time.


“I was nominated due to being a co-founder of the AIM (Autism Involves Me) group, which started in 2013. Also we were recognized for the work we did with the Port aux Basques Town Council, local businesses and citizens to create an autism-friendly community,” wrote Chaisson.


Lt. Governor Judy Foote made the announcement via Facebook on Thursday, Feb. 25. Although Chaisson knew before then, she was sworn to secrecy.


“I was home alone at the time and I almost burst wanting to tell someone! The lady told me that it was in strict confidence and anyone who knows me, knows how hard it is for me to not tell great news like this!”


This is not the first time that Chaisson and Billard have been recognized for their often innovative and pioneering efforts on behalf of people with autism. The two women and the group they built have been featured in national magazines and news media before, and have received awards and accolades too. But Chaisson is quick to point out that they’ve had some strong support along the way.


“I have been very honoured by the presentations and recognitions that have been given to me in the past. However, I always say that I accepted these honours on behalf of the citizens of our town and our autism families. Our citizens are outstanding and so accepting of those with autism spectrum disorder.”


Chaisson says that for the past nine years, Port aux Basques businesses and residents have become very aware of the characteristics of autism, their challenges and the ways that the community can come into their world, instead of forcing them to interact in our world.


“This has proven to be very successful, thus this is why the team from Today’s Parent (magazine), after being here for a week, said that Port aux Basques is the most Autism-Friendly Town in Canada.”


Although Chaisson doesn’t know who exactly nominated them for the award, she has found out that the nomination was submitted in 2017. Two people have also told her they were contacted to give references or answer questions about AIM’s accomplishments.


Initially, AIM was built as a support group, but it eventually developed into finding ways to build practical solutions for children and families. The group began fundraising to install sensory equipment and other necessary equipment, and even build sensory rooms in a local hotel and at schools.


“Ninety percent of these ideas originated from parents due to their challenges they had while travelling, visiting restaurants, attending medical appointments, focusing on school issues, etc.,” notes Chaisson. “Now that we are involved with the GoldRush Lottery and through private donations, we have moved back to being a support group once again.”


A former educator trained to help those with special needs, Chaisson also volunteers as a consultant for parents and continues to help them in any way she can. That means continuing to find new solutions as the children grow into adulthood.


“Our original children were young when we organized the group and some of them are now in high school or have graduated,” she points out. “Since autism is a spectrum, some children will go on to secondary education, some will be able to be employees in the public workforce and others will take part in stay-at-home occupations.”


Port aux Basques has been selected as part of a provincial adult occupational project, and Chaisson promises that AIM will do whatever it can to support the project and help it become a success.


“I am constantly receiving questions and inquiries from all over the world regarding how we became autism friendly. In fact, I will send in the book, ‘Becoming Autism Friendly’, to Ohio this week to a parent who wants to use it in her community. I am amazed at how all these people find me, and how far AIM has travelled around our globe.”


Once it becomes safe to travel again, Chaisson and Billard will accept their medals in person at Rideau Hall in Ottawa.",

    body: "The Gateway Status of Women Council’s annual Bread and Roses event has been a popular night in Port aux Basques for many years. With a full house of 230 women in attendance, this annual event includes guest speakers, music, food, prizes and celebration. This year, because of the COVID-19 Pandemic and current public health restrictions, it has been cancelled.


Suzanne Ingram was the Executive Director at the council for many years. She spoke of her passion to create a spectacular event, as the women of the community deserved to be celebrated in grand style. Her board over the years supported this vision, and the event continued to grow until it could not grow anymore – there is not another location in Port aux Basques that could hold more women. Suzanne and the board of directors wanted a special event that left women feeling treasured, special and empowered. A sentiment that continues to this day.


Ingram concluded, “An evening of celebration, but also of reflection. A time to think about women’s equality – what has been accomplished but also how much is still left to do. Bread and Roses flourished because so many women in our communities supported it and our organization made it a priority.”


Carol Ingram is Chair of the Gateway Status of Women Council.


She added “ I can think of no words to describe the power and influence of the Annual Bread and Roses Event.  Every single female in that room at that time contributes to the sense of purpose, strength and determination to be better and do better in continuing the fight for equality and acknowledgement.  I sincerely thank you all for being a part of that for me and for the women of this area.  While we are not together this year, your thoughts and reflections are just as motivating and powerful.”


Tanya Hawco, current Executive Director at the Gateway Women Centre, agrees.


“Bread and Roses has become a treasured tradition for many women in our area. When we asked our past guests to share what the event has meant to them, it was truly heartwarming to read the responses. This International Women’s Day event gives us an opportunity to connect with our community, share our work and celebrate together. There is a powerful energy in the room that stays with you long after you leave. We hope that we will be back together, safe and healthy, next year.”",

  body: "<b>March is National Nutrition Month!</b>
  
  
  Every year, dietitians across Canada celebrate and promote healthy eating during nutrition month. This year’s theme is Good for you!
  
  
  Dietitians help you find your healthy. Registered dietitians are the nutrition experts and understand the science of nutrition and the unique needs of each person based on their health, preferences, personal circumstances, culture and food traditions. These components shape the way we eat and influence what healthy eating looks like for each of us.
  
  
  There is no one-size-fits-all approach to healthy eating, and this is why something that works for someone else may not work for you. Healthy eating looks different for everyone.
  
  
  Get involved in nutrition month this year and kick-start a new healthy habit. If you are an otherwise healthy individual, ditch the diet and develop healthy habits that are sustainable.
  
  Instead of focusing on counting calories or restricting macronutrients (fat, carbohydrates or protein) which can lead to an unhealthy relationship with food, adopt a healthier outlook by eating a balanced diet with enough protein, fibre, carbohydrates and healthy fats. Remember, all foods fit in moderation.
  
  
  Keep healthy snacks on hand so you never go hungry, such as fruit with a handful of almonds, cut-up veggies with hummus, energy bites, or whole grain crackers and low-fat cheese. If you have a craving for something like chocolate or chips, have a small amount and enjoy it. This will not only satisfy your craving, but you’ll be less likely to overindulge later.
  
  Get creative in the kitchen! Participate in nutrition month by trying a new recipe.
  
  
  Maybe you’ll try meatless Monday with a plant-based protein such as tofu, lentils or beans. Plant-based proteins cost less compared to animal meat and are a great alternative. Put a spin on your favourite recipe and swap out chicken for tofu or replace ground meat with lentils.
  
  
  Do you have picky eaters at home? This nutrition month get the whole family involved in the meal process. Allow them to pick a recipe, choose a vegetable or fruit at the grocery store, and let them measure or stir ingredients while prepping. You’ll be surprised by how much they’ll want to eat the meal if they were involved in its preparation. Cooking with others is a great way to bond and it’s never too late to learn new skills!
  
  
  And lastly, it’s important to not only focus on what we eat, but also how we eat. This means being mindful of our eating habits. Notice your hunger cues. Do you feel hungry or are you just bored? Do you feel full? If not, eat more. Take time to eat. What does it taste like?
  
  What does it smell like? Eating should be an enjoyable experience, not a rushed one.
  
  
  Finding your healthy can mean eating locally whenever possible and eating the traditional foods that you enjoy, creating an inviting environment when you’re eating (listening to music, dimming the lights, setting the table) or cooking and eating with others.
  
  
  What can you do this month to find your healthy?",

    body: "International Women’s Day (March 8) is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women and girls. The day also marks a call to action for accelerating women’s equality and acknowledging that, while progress has been made, there is still much more to do.

International Women’s Day became official in March 1911 with the support of over one million people who demanded the realization of women’s rights.


Today, we celebrate all women in our lives. We celebrate the legacy of those women who have gone before us, whether feted or anonymous, who have contributed so much to the strength and spirit of our communities. We honour all women in our communities today who work tirelessly, at home, at work, as volunteers, leaders and caregivers. We celebrate every woman’s contributions and strengths.


Typically, at this time of year, we would be putting the finishing touches on our plans for our annual Bread and Roses Gala. This year however, our local celebrations look dramatically different. COVID-19 is the most serious public health crisis Canada has ever faced.


In recognition of the way this pandemic has disproportionately impacted women, this year’s national theme is #FeministRecovery. This theme recognizes that Covid-19 is a gendered crisis and that the pandemic has seriously eroded hard fought gains towards equality.

Today, we acknowledge and celebrate the many women who have persevered throughout this pandemic, those juggling working from home with supporting children’s online learning, caring for younger siblings and supporting who are isolated, ill or elderly.


We acknowledge and celebrate the many women working in essential services, going to work each day, putting their own health at risk, often while managing other challenges such as child care, health and family issues. We acknowledge and support all those women for whom home is not a safe haven.


According to Statistics Canada, 1 in 10 Canadian women are “very or extremely concerned” about the possibility of violence inside the home during the pandemic. We acknowledge and support the many women who have faced massive layoffs and reduction in income. RBC Economics is reporting that women’s labour market participation in Canada has dropped to levels not seen since the 1980s. Today, we recognize, support and celebrate all women.

To quote Economist Armine Yalnizyan, “There will be no economic recovery without a she-covery.” As we recover from this pandemic, we echo the hopes of many that we will not simply return to normal, but use this an opportunity to create a “better normal”- one where women and other marginalized populations not only survive, but thrive.",

NHL Noise


Last Sunday, Patrick Kane made the highlight reels when he scored his 400th NHL goal. Kane was drafted 1st overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in 2007 and joined the team for the 2007-08 season. He scored 72 points in his rookie year and received the Calder Memorial Trophy awarded to rookie of the year. 

Kane has been consistently dominant for Chicago. He has Hart, Art Ross and Conn Smythe trophies to his credit, and was vital to three Stanley Cup winning teams. He was also a Silver Medalist in the 2010 Olympic games. 

Kane is one of those athletes whose personal life casts a long shadow over professional accomplishments. But there is no doubting the impact he has had on the Blackhawks franchise, and he is evidence of how a team can draft their way out of ugly. Chicago’s window is closing now, but Kane continues to be a force.

Speaking of drafting their way out of ugly, that’s what the Buffalo Sabres have been trying to do since they drafted Jack Eichel 2nd overall in 2015. Despite adding talents that include Jack Quinn, Dylan Cozens and Rasmus Dahlin, the Sabres are in the basement of the East division. That’s not sitting well with Eichel, who is as contented as a cat in a jacuzzi. 

The rumour sharks can smell blood in the water, and there is much speculation about whether Eichel could end the season in Los Angeles, New York, Boston, or... What about Canadian teams? Both Ottawa and Montreal are teams rich in trade chips that can hardly be considered established at the centre position.  

Speaking of rumour sharks, we are five weeks away from the NHL trade deadline and the rumour mill is warming up. Losing teams are considering who they can move to improve for the future. The Nashville Predators have already established their clearance section, and it includes guys like Mattias Ekholm and Mikael Granlund. The Anaheim Ducks are reportedly ready to listen to offers on Filip Forsberg and Hampus Lindholm. 

Players who signed one-year deals in the off-season – guys like Taylor Hall and Bobby Ryan – are googling moving companies. 

I’ll be watching GM Jim Benning and how he handles the deadline in Vancouver. It’s looking like playoffs will be off the table for the Canucks, and several bad contracts are shining an uncomfortable spotlight on Benning. If he’s still employed on trade deadline day he may be wheeling and dealing to try and keep his job, and that could be entertaining. 

The Toronto Maple Leafs will be paying attention to who may have a goalie they can add for a playoff run. Would Ryan Miller in Anaheim or Pekka Rinne in Nashville appeal to the Leafs as a veteran option behind Andersen? Or is the plan to ride Freddie like a rented mule?

Speaking of goalies, on Tuesday during the second intermission of the Habs and Sens game, the Montreal Canadiens fired goaltending coach Stéphane Waite. In Habs circles we call this The Cammalleri, calling to mind the night of January 12, 2012 when Michael Cammalleri was traded in the middle of a game. 

In most markets, this news would be as exciting as an episode of The Littlest Hobo. But this is hockey-crazed Montreal where expectations are high, and the team has been under-performing. That includes their $10.5 million goalie, Carey Price, whose performance has seen dramatic peaks and valleys in recent years. Sean Burke has been named the Director of Goaltending for the Canadiens and has inherited a big task under bright lights.




Raptors Racket

The Toronto Raptors experienced their first coronavirus game postponement this week. On Monday night the NBA announced that Tuesday’s game would be tentatively rescheduled for Wednesday night due to positive test results and the necessary subsequent contract tracing. The Raptors had become more consistent in recent weeks and were in a tie for 5th place in the conference when the interruption was announced.

In the meanwhile, The Toronto Star reported this week that Kyle Lowry’s North Toronto home had been sold pending a home inspection and financing. This should not be shocking for fans as Lowry’s contract is due to expire at the end of this season, and the team is unable to play games at home for the rest of the year due to the pandemic. But the development does fuel speculation that Lowry will be moved at the trade deadline.




Blue Jays Babble

Grapefruit League – the name given to exhibition games played by teams who run their spring training in Florida – is underway. The Toronto Blue Jays have started well, but these games are about assessing the roster in a real game situation so that decisions can be made ahead of opening day.

The decisions that remain are significant. The outfield is packed like sardines in a can, while legitimate options for the starting rotation are sparser. But the good news is that Spring training will be followed by Summer ball, and we can all breathe a sigh of relief for that.

    subtitles: "One of Mark Lomond’s favourite photos on the Historic Port aux Basques page is this cove full of boats floating near Lemmietown, circa 1930s. - SUBMITTED",
    body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Mark Lomond has always been fascinated with local history, old pictures, buildings, and antiques. It’s the reason why he started the Facebook page, ‘Historic Port aux Basques’.


“I had a modest collection of old photographs of Port aux Basques that I collected over the years on the internet. I know from experience the power Facebook has to collect, organize, and share information and photos. I thought why not use the photos I have as some content to get a group started – one where old photos, stories and interesting facts about the area could be shared in hopes to give everyone a better look into the town’s fascinating history,” says Lomond.


It wasn’t long before the page started to attract followers, and not just from locals. Lomond says that in addition to the locals who post old photos, the group has seen a number of contributions from former residents around the globe.


“Apparently there’s a lot of people who have a little bit of history to share,” notes Lomond.

The page now has almost 3,000 followers, which represents most of the town’s population. Some share family photos, offering a glimpse into the youth of loved ones now gone, while others seek information to identify faces.


With so many members, Lomond asked one of the more frequent contributors to help moderate the page.


“I noticed an old friend, Krista Savory, was sharing quite a few photos and seemed really engaged in the group,” says Lomond. “Krista has since scoured the internet and found an unbelievable amount of photos, newspaper articles, and stories to share with everyone.”


There doesn’t appear to be a shortage of information to pour through. The page offers plenty from the heartfelt to the humourous to enthrall anyone who enjoys history, whether or not they have ties to the area.


Some of the more fascinating posts are mere snippets of old newspaper articles that pre-date Confederation. A clipping from The London Standard in Great Britain, dated Friday, Aug. 7, 1868 reports that five stowaway boys were cast off the ship, the Arran, on the ice pans near Cape Anguille. The ship had been bound for Québec, and afterwards the Captain and Mate stood trial for mistreating the boys.


“Six biscuits were thrown to the boys on the ice, and I watched them as they went across. We could see land distinctly without a glass. I have been in the Arctic regions before, and as near as I can judge I should say that the land was about 20 miles from the ship,” testified Robert Hunter, a seaman residing in Glasgow.


A more humorous but no less gripping article in the Western Star on March 30, 1906 reveals workers in Cape Ray left some dynamite to thaw near a stove and then promptly forgot about it. The resulting explosion completely destroyed the home of Mrs. Richard Skeard, with whom they had been lodging, but luckily they all made it out the door just in time.

Lomond says that there are plenty more stories like those in the group for history buffs to enjoy. He easily offers up a variety of suggestions.


“With tales of murders, disasters, a movie filming, historical events, old traditions, lost businesses and people, there’s always plenty of interesting content to check out,” says Lomond, before adding, “Can’t forget the monkey stories. There have been at least three or four different monkeys here in the last 80 years.”


Lomond and this unofficial group of local historians primarily turn to the internet to source materials. It can be time consuming to pour through mountains of information and photos on public domain websites or old newspaper archives, but lately that isn’t proving to be a hindrance. People have plenty of time on their hands these days.


Says Lomond, “I got a lot of positive messages and comments about the group. It seems it has helped bring many people closer together, giving them some relief from the feeling of being isolated and alone during the pandemic.”",

    subtitles: "Port aux Basques town council held another virtual meeting on Wednesday evening, March 10. - ©FILE PHOTO",
    body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Town Council is hoping to avoid a fine for developing the Grand Bay West Trail, and Matador Mining asking council for some minor planning permission as the company prepares to make its return to the area.

These matters were among the discussion during the most recent virtual council meeting, which was held last Tuesday evening, Mar. 10. All councillors were in attendance at the Fire Hall, while a few members of the public attended via video conference.


Proclamation

Mayor John Spencer opened the meeting with a proclamation recognizing March 26 as Epilepsy Awareness Day. Also known as Purple Day, people are encouraged to wear purple to raise awareness of those with epilepsy.


Stephenville flights

Sunwing has announced that it will operate flights to provincial airports in St. John’s, Gander and Stephenville this summer. Flights will depart daily between Toronto and Stephenville on Wednesdays, starting June 9 until Sept. 1. 

“I encourage people on the Southwest corner to look into that,” said Spencer.


Matador Mining

A letter from Matador Mining requesting permission to place two shipping containers near their rental offices at the old Stan Dawe’s building on Water Street West has been approved. Council has the ability to grant discretionary permission without necessitating a permit or public advertising. The containers will be used as testing labs. The Australian-based company continues to explore its Cape Ray gold shield and prefers to test outside in the containers rather than inside the building.

“We’ve got to let these new companies know that we’re willing to work with them,” said Coun. Jim Lane.


Grand Bay West Trail

A letter from Crown Lands notified Council that the renewal application showed the trail approved under the license is dramatically different than what is actually in place. Crown Lands requires an amendment to the license to cover the development that has taken place, along with an amendment application fee of $172.50. The letter also stated that the Town would incur an occupancy fine of $1,000.

From the last time it was renewed until now, the section between the farm and Taverner Drive was not included in the provincial inventory of trail systems, explained Town Manager Leon MacIsaac.

“Because it’s not there it’s considered illegal to occupy, so we have to re-apply to get permission to have that trail in place.”

“So we have to pay that $1,000 because we expanded the plan,” said Spencer. “There’s no way we can pay that $1,000.”

Council will reach out to see if there’s anything that can be done to have the fine removed, particularly as the trail has been in place for so many years already. It may have even received funding for development in the first place, though records will have to be checked to confirm that.

“They signed on the bottom line but they didn’t realize we didn’t have the land,” observed Spencer. “We’ll just look into that.”




Snow clearing

Coun. Lane spoke told Council that recently he took his grandsons to the bus shelter near Smallwood Drive only to find it completely filled with snow. Children were playing in the area and that almost caused an accident.

“One little kid must have gone up around, and when he came down the bus driver slammed on his brakes,” said Lane. “I tell you it was a scary thing.”

Lane asked Council if there was any plan for clearing the shelters after a significant snowfall.

“We clear the bus shelters once we get the main roads and the fire hydrants open,” replied MacIsaac.

Lane observed that three days after a storm, many of the hydrants still remain buried, which presents a problem should the fire department have to respond to an emergency.

Part of problem with snow clearing seems to stem from the fact that equipment operators must travel a bit further to dump snow, since sites they used in the past are no longer available.

“We can’t dump on private property. We’ve had a number of complaints over the years,” offered MacIsaac.

Because homeowners have asked the town not to dump snow on their property anymore, that means the snow has to be hauled further away and this tends to slow the removal process.

“Then main sites get more cumbersome for storing snow,” MacIsaac pointed out. “We’ve been fortunate this year that we haven’t had a lot of snow, but the snow we’ve gotten the past week has been quite a large amount in a very short period of time.”

Higher density sites need to have the snow removed from the streets, the sidewalks and the large banks cleared back to reach the hydrants and bus shelters, noted MacIsaac. The recent series of back to back storms also meant that some areas were unable to be cleared in between, which only made the problem worse. In addition, during heavy storms it can be more difficult for operators to judge. They must be quite careful where they are piling large quantities and not dump snow past the marker poles lest they drive the loader overboard. Then an excavator has to be brought in to push the snow out further to make room for more.


Parking ban

Coun. Lane also observed that during the last storm, a vehicle that had been parked on the street during clearing, contrary to winter parking rules. However it did not get towed away.

“That car was on the road for three days. The plow had to go around,” said Lane, who observed that a motorist swerving to avoid it actually struck the mirror on another truck.

Town Clerk Julia Ingram explained that the RCMP must ticket it and have it towed away, because if Town calls it in, they are liable for the towing fees, where if the RCMP initiates the vehicle’s removal, then the owner must pay the fine and the towing charge.",

    subtitles: "Road conditions can deteriorate quite quickly during a snow storm, as Cathy McIsaac recently found out the hard way. - SUBMITTED",
    body: "SOUTHWEST COAST – “I left work at midnight, like I always do,” begins Cathy McIsaac, as she begins recounting her harrowing experience on Mar. 2. Later that Tuesday night, as events unfolded, Cathy would more or less live blog her ordeal via Facebook.

The weather that night was fairly bad admits Cathy, but, “I was following the side of the road, the shoulder of the road.”


That particular snowstorm, one of three that battered the Southwest Coast region within a short span of only a few days, brought whiteout conditions, blowing snow, and a Wreckhouse wind warning in excess of 100 km/h. Most folks were hunkered in for the night, just hoping they wouldn’t lose power, but McIsaac had just finished her shift at Marine Atlantic, and wanted to get back to her home in Doyles. 


She climbed into her SUV, a Honda CRV, and hit the road. Unfortunately for Cathy, she didn’t get very far. 


“Up there, across from the first dump, the old one, the road was plowed pretty widely there, so I went too close to the shoulder, and I went down in the ditch.”


Luckily she wasn’t hurt and neither was her SUV, but both were hopelessly stuck in the middle of a raging blizzard. At first Cathy tried to get the car out but quickly realized it was a lost cause, so she called a friend at work to ask them to call a tow truck. She posted her first message of the night on her timeline at 12:59 a.m.


“Somebody please call tow truck. I am up by new dump. Stuck.”


As she waited to see if her tow was coming, Cathy kept her car running, wisely deciding not to try to walk along the highway and becoming disoriented or struck by another vehicle. 

Advice from her Facebook contacts poured in, offering tips, safety instructions, and an abundance of worry. 


“They called everyone. The police, the tow truck, the fire department, but they couldn’t get up. The visibility was the worst I’ve ever seen,” recalls Cathy. “The police tried to get to me, but they couldn’t get there.”


She provided worried friends with another status update at 2:38 a.m. 


“I am here for the night. Cruiser went off road trying to get to me.”


The RCMP did indeed try to reach her but after driving their own SUV off the road, constables had no choice but to call off their efforts to reach McIsaac to protect their own safety. Because of the extremely poor conditions, tow truck operators were unwilling to make any attempt. 


McIsaac says she had no emergency kit or equipment in her vehicle, but was lucky to still be in her work coveralls, which kept her toasty warm. She did have a beverage with her as well. 

She kept her window opened slightly to keep fresh air circulating, and kept pushing her door open to prevent a buildup of snow. 


“I’m very claustrophobic, so if the snow had built up and covered me, then that’s when I would have gone into panic mode.” 


To pass the time, once she knew she was in for the long haul, Cathy talked to friends on her cell phone most of the night. Fortunately she had her cell phone charger with her, so she wasn’t left feeling completely isolated. At 7:08 a.m., Cathy got her SUV out of the ditch. 


“Barry Furlong came along, in his pickup, and he towed me on.”


Looking back on the night’s events, Cathy admits, “I should have stayed where I was at. I don’t listen very well. I’m a very stubborn person. Couple of coworkers told me to stay, and I didn’t listen.”


She offers up a piece of advice.


“I chose to go, because I got there every other time. But you’re better off staying where your to. And make sure you have warm clothes, something to drink, and a cell charger.”


She is grateful for all the concern expressed by those who saw her Facebook post, saying that she can’t name everyone who helped her that night, or she’d never remember them all.

    subtitles: "Viola Parsons has several accordions in her collection, including the one she is holding, an antique instrument originally intended for her grandfather. - SUBMITTED",
    body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Viola Parsons is proof that it really is never too late to learn. Although she came to play music later in life, her love for it began during childhood.


Although neither of her parents played, Viola remembers that there was a lot of music coming from her father’s side of the family. She used to particularly enjoy a cousin who used to visit during Christmas and play music for the family.


Viola admits she’s a bit fuzzy on the details, but seems to recall that it was actually her sister who was gifted a harmonica by their mother one Christmas.


“I would find this harmonica, and I really felt like I was really stealing something that didn’t belong to me, which of course I was,” she chuckles softly.


Viola would retreat to her mother’s closet, settle in behind the clothes to muffle the music, and practice on her sister’s harmonica.


“That’s my memory of it, because if it was my mouth organ, I wouldn’t have hidden away with it. I don’t think I would have,” says Viola.


It was in the back of the closet that Viola, around 10 or 11 years old, practiced until she could learn to play ‘Oh Susannah’. Her mother must have figured out what she was up to, because the next Christmas she gifted Viola with her own harmonica.


She enjoyed playing, but as she grew into adulthood and got married, had her children and moved into the workforce, music seemed to slip by the wayside.


“I must have planted a seed for it later in life and it did grow a little tiny bit,” says Viola.


She kept a harmonica anyway, and perhaps on occasion she would pull it out to play every now and again. Her husband wasn’t always so keen at first.


“Albert, he thought, that was not very cool.”


She chuckles a wee bit at the memory, and couldn’t really say if it was the harmonica music or Viola’s playing that he wasn’t particularly enamoured with initially. Most of the time the harmonica waited patiently in a drawer. Viola and Albert had three children, and it wasn’t until they were adults before they learned that their mother could play the harmonica.


“I thought once I finished work, that will be one thing that I will take out and enjoy,” shares Viola.


After retirement back in 1997, she pulled the harmonica out of the drawer and began playing once again. At some point, Albert got a bit more used to it says Viola.


“Now he’s my biggest supporter!”


It was her church that prompted Viola to really begin playing outside the home. Around 10 years ago, the ladies of the church wanted to form a little band, and a couple of them shared they could play the guitar or another instrument. She was a bit uncertain, but Viola offered to play too.


“The harmonica doesn’t get played much,” she says, “not on this end of the island anyway.”


She was welcomed into the Little Band, and as a regular churchgoer she was familiar enough with the hymns to be comfortable playing them.


“We play for funerals, and we’ll play in a church service, but that’s the extent of that,” says Viola.


Naturally, her favourite music to play is Newfoundland music.


Around the time she began playing at the church, Viola visited her mother, who was doing some house clearing. She spotted a small accordion, with only one row of buttons.


“Where in the world did you ever get that?” Viola recalls asking her mother. “It was a gift that she had given her father back when she came off the island – down in Pass Island – and came to North Sydney to work. She had given that to her father for Christmas one year. I never ever knew it existed. I never knew her Dad played, because he was dead by the time I came along.”


Viola received permission to take the accordion home, ‘just to see’. She confesses that she had always wanted to learn the accordion, and this seemed like a good time to start.


“Now there wasn’t much life left to that accordion,” admits Viola. “But I would say that, in less than a couple of hours, I was able to play Oh Susannah.”


Viola’s ear for music is evident. She doesn’t read or write music, and has had no formal training, but she can learn a tune by listening to it and picking away it on an instrument. She says learning to play by ear is an advantage.


“Like anything, it’s just a matter of practice,” observes Viola. “When they tell me we’re going to do this in C, all I know is that on my accordion or on my harmonica, there is a C, so I look for my C.”


She’s a bit of a late bloomer as a musical performer, but in her heart and mind Viola wouldn’t mind learning to play the mandolin.


“I might not have the fingers for it now,” she laughs.


Not long after she started playing with the church, and much to her surprise, she and Ray Bown discovered they had music in common. Bown was a former work colleague but the two hadn’t socialized much before retirement.


“I didn’t know he could play and he didn’t know I could play,” recalls Viola. “That was funny.”


Bown became somewhat of a mentor to Viola, and the duo were joined by Leo Coffin. They began performing here and there around the town, and during the summer would play at Scott’s Cove for the tourists and locals who liked to gather.


“Ray and Company I think the town put on us,” offers Viola about the trio’s band name. “I don’t know. We don’t have a name per se.”


Viola describes playing with Ray and Leo as a pure joy. Their happy trio have ventured to Eastport for a number of years to play in its accordion festival, but thanks to COVID-19 that got cancelled.


She misses playing on the harbourfront for the tourists, and hopes that with the vaccinations underway they will at least be able to resume playing for their own little bubbles. Perhaps in the near future she might perform at a Come Home Year festival.


“If there’s anywhere I could (play), I surely would,” promises Viola.",

This month’s dessert is Lucky Charm Éclairs, which are filled with a green pastry cream and topped with a green chocolate ganache. (Bigne Portafortuna con crema pasticcera)


Note: It’s best to eat these fresh, on the day they are made, as they don’t tend to keep well.


Ingredients:

1 cup of Lucky Charm cereal

 (no marshmallows)

1 cup of all purpose flour

1 cup of water

½ cup of butter

4 large eggs

½ cup of white chocolate chips or 2 white chocolate bars

4. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition until batter is smooth.

5. Transfer batter to a pastry bag ( if you do not have a pastry bag, you can use a ziploc bag with one corner cut) and in 4-5 inch rectangles pipe out dough.

6. Bake for 35 minutes or until golden brown. Turn off oven and leave eclairs in the oven with door slightly ajar for 15 minutes. Cool on wire rack.

7. In a small saucepan heat cream to a simmer, pour over white chocolate, and stir to combine. Tint with green food colouring.

8. In a medium bowl, combine yolks, whole egg, and 2 tbsp of sugar. Add corn starch and flour, whisk until pale yellow.

9. In a medium saucepan add milk and the rest of your sugar, heat to a simmer.

10. Whisking constantly, add the milk in the egg mixture slowly, then pour back in the pot and heat while stirring continuously until thickened.

11. Once thickened add butter, vanilla, and green food colouring. Stir until butter is melted. Let cool.

12. Using a skewer, to poke a hole through the eclairs, Pipe pastry cream into each éclair. Top with the green ganache and finish with some lucky charm marshmallows.",

NHL Noise

I’d sooner be strung up by my eyelids and tickled until I blink than write this, but the Toronto Maple Leafs are the best team in the Scotia North Division. With half the games for the 2020-21 season in the history books, it’s time for our second quarterly review. 

I predicted the Leafs would win the division in my first review, and they’ve only gotten stronger. Auston Matthews, playing with a wrist injury, is on pace for 44 goals in a compressed season. Mitch Marner is on pace for 73 points.

Their forward group and the power play are the envy of the division, even if most of us prefer not to admit it.

The other safe prediction was that the Ottawa Senators would finish in the basement. As of press deadline, the Sens had twice as many losses as wins. They will finish last, but not before they wreak havoc on the teams above them. They have a young group that will eventually be potent. All twelve Sens fans have a bright future to look forward to. 

The rest of the Canadian division is murkier than pea soup. I predicted the Vancouver Canucks would miss the playoffs – that prediction stands. GM Jim Benning recently gave Coach Travis Green a vote of confidence, and in the absence of a dramatic trade, Green is working with a flawed line up.

I predicted the Winnipeg Jets and Montreal Canadiens would compete for 2nd and 3rd place, and the Battle of Alberta would determine the 4th playoff slot. The outcome may depend on how three of those teams adjust to major changes.

The Jets had a slow start, followed by the trade of two significant regulars. Following quarantine, Pierre-Luc Dubois joined the team, and my expectation is that the Jets will add at the trade deadline and only get stronger as the playoffs approach. 

After a strong start the Habs skidded to a halt, and GM Marc Bergevin shook things up by firing coaches and inserting a new leadership group. That new group is now trying to right the ship, and with a little trade deadline help – perhaps earlier with an injury to Ben Chiarot on Wednesday – I’m predicting the Habs will wind up the regular season at their strongest. 

After getting off to an 11-11-2 start, the Calgary Flames fired Coach Geoff Ward and replaced him with Darryl Sutter. Sutter’s teams are famously fast and intense, and he has had previous success with the Flames, taking them to a cup final in 2004. It has the makings of a good story, but I expect the climax will come with a late season elimination from the playoffs.

In Edmonton, the Oilers have had a little less drama surrounding them. They’ve been steadily average, which is enough to have them in 4th place. If they want to make noise in the post-season, GM Ken Holland needs to find support for his stars like no GM before him has been able to do. I expect a 4th place finish.  

So, at the halfway point, I’m predicting Leafs versus Oilers, and Habs versus Jets for the first round of the playoffs.

Next week we’ll look at trade targets for each of these teams.


Raptors Racket

While professional sports leagues around the world are trying to get through their seasons unscathed due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the NBA thought an all-star game would be a good idea. Classic NBA.

The all-star game was originally cancelled, but the NBA shifted course and held a one-night event in Atlanta on March 7th. This happened, despite concerns expressed by several players who were selected to play. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms encouraged fans to watch on TV rather than making their way to her city. 

The Raptors entered the break with a 17-19 record and in eighth place in the Eastern conference.


Blue Jays Babble

In Florida, Blue Jays pitching roster clarity is coming as they progress through the Grapefruit League schedule. Stephen Matz, acquired from the Mets in January, started his pre-season with two games where he didn’t allow a run. He’s making a genuine play to make the starting rotation.

Nate Pearson, Toronto’s prized pitching prospect, was a hopeful to join this year’s starter group. A groin strain has interfered with this plan and opened the door for someone else. Veteran southpaw Hyun-Jin Ryu is expected to be the Jays ace, but behind him a lot of question marks remain.

When asked about the rotation, Blue Jays President Mark Shapiro acknowledged this is their “area of least experience” and they don’t expect the Jays will be a perfect team this year. He said they will adjust as they go, but he is building toward an era of a championship calibre team.

Patience for the short term. Better times ahead. Something we can all identify with.

    subtitles: "Some services, including RCMP and Waste Management, are examples of existing regionalization along the Southwest Coast, but is there opportunity for more that towns can avail of to reduce taxpayer burden? - VIA TWITTER",
    body: "In January 2021, Municipalities Newfoundland and Labrador (MNL) presented a Municipal Solutions Platform to its members. The document, which is available online at municipalnl.ca, outlines key advocacy priorities for MNL, including municipal financial sustainability, innovation in infrastructure, and regionalization among other pressing issues.

Regionalization has been promoted in this area over the past few years, including via a public Q&A at the College of the North Atlantic in Port aux Basques. It can be argued that some regionalization has already taken place.

The Dr. Charles L. LeGrow Health Centre, for example, is located in Port aux Basques but serves the entirety of the Southwest Coast, as does the local RCMP detachment. Waste management is also a shared service, and the fire departments have agreements in place to render support to each other.

But in the wake of shrinking tax bases, limited service and escalating expenses, MNL believes that by sharing costs and services, communities can be even stronger together.

With that in mind, the Wreckhouse Weekly posed a series of four questions to municipal leaders along the Southwest Coast. Municipal leaders from Port aux Basques (Mayor John Spencer), Isle aux Morts (Mayor Nelson Lillington) and Rose Blanche-Harbour Le Cou (Town Council) responded via e-mail.


Q: Have you had a chance to review the platform yet?


IAM: I have reviewed the platform. Regionalization has been discussed for years and the residents of Small Town NL do not support Regionalized Municipal Governments. If the Provincial Government is aiming at regionalizing services then the SW Coast has been doing that for a long time. Our Waste Management is a shared service, we assist one another with Fire Departments and the ambulance services.


PAB: The model for regionalism that has exited in other jurisdictions in Canada will not exist in NL for a long time. Newfoundland has no history of regional government. 

What does exist are many areas with no governance models what so ever, areas with governance models in the form of volunteer-appointed boards created out of necessity for common services (i.e. water supply) and areas incorporated as municipalities under legislation.

Thrown in the mix of all of this, outside of the Avalon, is a shrinking, aging, scattered population where even the organized legislative municipalities are struggling to survive the fiscal realities of maintaining aging infrastructure, new regulatory processes and adding to services. In other words, towns such as Port Aux Basques are very expensive to operate in fulfilling a mandate of residential services.


RB: They have not yet had a chance to review the platform however there are many areas of regionalization that will not pertain to this community due to the demographics to the area.

Council is not opposed to the idea of regionalization where it is in the best interest of the community and members.


Q: What are your thoughts on the fiscal realities of your town as it pertains to Part 1 (Stable Fiscal Reality for the municipal sector), and is regionalization a possible solution being considered as the tax base declines?


IAM: For the day to day operations of the Town of Isle Aux Morts we are capable of maintaining all the current services that we currently have. With property taxes, poll taxes, the MOG and Gas Taxes this town council have not had to cut or reduce any services provided or have a drastic increase in taxation in the three and a half years that I have been Mayor.


PAB: Provincial and federal governments are aware of the financial difficulties facing municipalities. It is for this reason that representatives of both levels of government work tirelessly seeking programming funding for everything from street improvements, the provision of clean drinking water and fire services.

However, most often it is never enough with crippling formulas forcing communities to borrow to participate in given the limited options for local revenues.


Q: What are your thoughts on climbing infrastructure costs as it pertains to Part 2 (Innovation in Infrastructure) and is your town planning to employ more green solutions to help offset these costs. If so, what are some green solutions you are exploring?


IAM: The cost of infrastructure upgrades is unbelievable. This past Fall the Town of Isle Aux Morts conducted Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the Water and Sewer upgrades through the Capital Works Program.

The cost to upgrade water lines and to add to the towns sewer system in these phase was approximately $750,000, the Town was responsible for 10% of this cost. For this price we got maybe 1.5 kms of new pavement and 25 new houses that will be added to the sewer system in the fall.

Whether Regionalization becomes a reality or not these prices makes it unlikely that small town NL will ever achieve sufficient wastewater treatment.


PAB: Primary sources of revenue for municipalities are based on property taxes, commercial taxes, and grants. The narrow focus of taxes on property and commercial activity does limit funding available to municipalities.

Residents and businesses cannot afford to pay more. There needs to be a new source of income for municipalities. This should be tied to federal and provincial taxes.

A small portion of sales tax towards the operational cost of municipalities would take the burden of an uncertain future facing crumbling infrastructure with little option other to borrow to replace water and sewer systems, streets and other services.


Q: Do you believe that your town lacks any municipal supports to attract new residents or serve your current residents?


IAM: Attracting new residents will always be difficult, however, I believe that the Town of Isle aux Morts has the municipal supports to serve the current residents.


PAB: Regional government along the Southwest corner will not happen, just as it will not happen in many areas of the province. While geographically it appears to be a natural fit as a region from South Branch to Rose Blanche, the distance between the two boundaries is too vast.

What does work, and does have a future, is regional services such as what we see now in terms of waste management. This same element of successful cooperation can exist in the form of savings for municipalities within the region in relation to a common identity in purchasing supplies such as salt and sand for winter road conditions.

Regional participation and support for recreational activities and tourism does exist and can be built upon. As an example there are great benefits to be derived for the entire area in relation to trail way development and promotion of tourism. Marketing the entire area as one benefits all within the region.

But beyond regional planning and sharing any formalized legislated form of regional government will not happen.




RB: We do not feel the town lacks any municipal support in attracting new residents. We currently have approximately 60 seasonal residents in our community.",

    body: "I have a few jobs here at the Wreckhouse Weekly. I am the editor, sales director, print manager, procurement officer, distribution agent and the fix-it-upper. 

Mondays tend to be my busiest days, when I prep and deliver the print edition to stores around the region, from Millville to Isle aux Morts. As you might expect, I get to meet and chat with a lot of different people. I am a very social guy, so schmoozing suits me fine. 


I am also more than happy to talk about the newspaper, and listen to opinions, ideas, compliments and complaints. I’ll take it all, because without feedback, we will never grow. We won’t expand our paper, we wont have columnists or contributors, and most importantly, active and engaged readers. 

But there is one idea that I can’t seem to get people to shake – that the Wreckhouse Weekly is somehow the new Gulf News.


I understand that for most of the Southwest Coast, the only newspaper they have known for the better part of five decades was the Gulf News. But let me be clear. We are NOT the Gulf News. 


Old habits can die hard, and old sayings may never die, but I am here to tell you, the Gulf News is dead. SaltWire began combining or closing some of its smaller newspapers in the province even before COVID-19 started, citing low interest and reduced sales revenue. 

We here at Wreckhouse Weekly saw the writing on the wall way before that. My sister, Rosalyn, was their reporter for two years before leaving. Without a local reporter, their coverage instead focused on mostly provincial news, or federal reports, things that held no real bearing for us locally. Sure, sometimes they’d try to get a local point of view, but overall the issue was primarily presented as originating from outside this region, instead of from within.


That’s not what is needed here though, at least not in our opinion, and even before the Gulf News closed up shop we had already identified a huge void when it came to local news coverage. That’s not to say there was no public appetite for it either. Five seconds on any of the local Facebook pages proves otherwise, to say nothing of the rumour mill. 

So on our own, with no connection to any other media organization, we started our own newspaper. From scratch. In our home. Alone. 


Our mission, our goal, was clear from the outset. This region has plenty of important stories to share about people who deserve recognition beyond a local tie-in quote for someone else’s story.


We rely exclusively on quality, relevant, and timely local content to entice readers and advertisers, which is not what the Gulf News was doing well before it closed up shop.

So I confess, when someone mentions us as the Gulf News, or associates us with them, it can ruffle my feathers a wee bit. Being the social guy that I am, I usually make sure to let people know that no, we most certainly are not the Gulf News.


You can call us the Wreckhouse, or The Weekly, or The Wreckhouse Weekly or even the local paper because that’s exactly what we are. Okay we offer a variety of print services too, but you know what I mean. 


We want to do better, be better and serve you better than they ever did. In a hundred years, we want people to read about you and run to the print edition to verify who you are, what you did, and why it mattered.",

    body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Lockdowns that have frustrated residential consumers are also playing part in delays affecting all levels of government. But factors other than the pandemic have delayed matters for the Canadian Coast Guard’s (CCG) regional operations, which has yet to fully relocate to its new facility near Hopedale Avenue in the Grand Bay West Industrial Park.


“The transition period from the existing Canadian Coast Guard Marine Communications and Traffic Services (MCTS) building in Port aux Basques to our new building has been extended due to some outstanding technical and structural work,” stated Janet Kelly, Communications Advisor for Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard. “There was also a delay related to contracting and permits for utility work required to bring high-speed internet from the main fibre-optic cable onto our property.”


Responding to e-mail inquiries, Kelly noted that the pandemic has certainly played its part in delaying the move from the CCG’s present Army Hill facility.


“We have experienced longer than usual lead times for procurement, as well as varying restrictions on contractor site access, due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” wrote Kelly.


Delays in most consumer items are a matter of course during the winter months due to storms that can delay ferry crossings, even without a global pandemic. Construction materials remain in high demand, and that has driven prices even higher for consumers.

Plans to install a new dehumidification system for the pool area of the Bruce II have also been delayed, since the pandemic has also impacted the provincial election.


“The tender for the Dextron unit replacement at the Bruce II complex, as with all tenders prepared for this year’s construction season, can’t be issued until after the election has been finalized. Official approvals from government departments would be very difficult to obtain during this time,” Town Manager Leon MacIsaac stated via e-mail.


Currently the  Marine Communications and Traffic Services (MCTS) Centre continues to operate out of the Army Hill facility, which directly overlooks the harbour. That site was originally constructed in 1977 and is regularly exposed to extremely harsh weather, especially in winter.


Weather and sustainability played key factors in the overall decision to build the new facility. Upgrades include better natural light, which is intended to help promote the health and well-being of its staff. Some of them have already made the move into the new building, wrote Kelly.


“While our MCTS Officers continue to work at the Army Hill site, staff from our Integrated Technical Services group are already working in the technical workshop space at the new building. We hope to complete our transition to the new building later this spring.”


There are no plans to hire more staff for the regional MCTS Centre, but the Coast Guard is presently accepting applications for new employees at other MCTS locations.

    body: "I will show my age in this piece. In the end, I hope to make a point – maybe not one that is surprising but still worth telling.


Have you ever heard of a telex? Compared to today it is ancient. In 1971, it was a remarkable telecommunications device that I encountered when I joined the federal manpower department in Grand Falls as an employment counselor. 


Upon encountering this wonderful piece of equipment, I found out that I could communicate to other offices by originating a message from our office and send it instantly to other manpower offices across the country.

At the time, central Newfoundland had many operating mines and some closures. There was quite a good mining culture in the region, and there were both skilled and often unskilled workers who were willing to move to new mines across the country. 


With one interview and a brief telex outlining qualifications, in no time I could be sending somebody to a mine in Ontario or Manitoba. No big human resource departments were involved, just my recommendation that the worker was genuine.


The department had a program that paid the moving costs for the worker and family. You won’t find that anymore, but as a newly-minted councillor I took full advantage of it.

I don’t know how many we sent across the country, but in its heyday, and over several years, our office was pretty big in the moving business. Major local industrial projects benefited from this service too, i.e. Churchill Falls hydro construction, mines in Labrador and others. 

Our countrymen have always been a mobile crowd.


Before confederation the number of locals headed for the “Boston states” (New York and Boston) was a pretty big deal for our mobile workforce. Newfoundlanders were known as great workers, building skyscrapers in New York. Then after confederation, Toronto and Ontario seemed to be the place to go. Our workers had a great reputation.


I met a guy here in rural Ontario who flew our provincial flag on his property. I passed by his place a few times and finally drove in his driveway. I said I was looking for a Newfoundlander. There had to be one here somewhere.


I was pointed down the driveway to a man who, in a few short minutes, told me his story. He was the product of a family who in the 1950’s moved to Ontario. He never lived in the province but his relationship was pretty strong through his parents and extended family. The flag prominently displayed in front of his house was his statement of allegiance.


Folks in the Southwest coast part of Newfoundland probably did not see this play out quite as I describe. The strong presence of the railway and ferry operations in this region were big employers at the time. Likewise, the almost year-round fishery that had deep sea operations and fish plants benefited the regional workforce greatly.


However, in later years, with employment diminishing in these sectors, the southwest coast workforce became more mobile. Along with the rest of the province, the Alberta oil and gas economy became a magnet. My seasonal visits back here were highlighted by much new housing, evident in the more rural communities especially. I was told much of that came from Alberta “oil money.”


There’s been lots written about how the Alberta’s booming economy benefited Newfoundland and Labrador. A CBC piece I came upon, written last year, is still relevant to the situation today.


It comes as no surprise that many workers in the “fly-in, fly out” category work largely in the oil and gas sector. Those workers have seen quite a change the past year or so as Alberta’s unemployment rate shot up to around 11% in 2020. The same year, the Alberta economy shrank by almost 6%. These are big numbers for this usually prosperous province and local workers and their communities in NL have no doubt felt it.


As another point of reference, my source points out that in 2014 Newfoundland and Labrador, workers made nearly $1.1 billion working outside the province and $700M of that was earned in Alberta. My information is that, at its peak in 2018, 14,000 people from the province commuted to work in Alberta alone.


There is always some lag in getting current information, but we know the situation has greatly worsened in recent years. As news stories tell us, for our mobile workforce the COVID pandemic has only made things worse.


Whatever recovery there is for the oil and gas sector, both in Newfoundland and Alberta, things will likely be slow and never reach the highs experienced in past years.

My personal experiences which I just recounted shows worker mobility has been ever thus in Newfoundland Believe it or not, the mining industry today shows real promise, but we need more to happen to take up the slack of a diminished oil and gas industry both within the province and in Alberta.


Where do we go from here? The precarious state of the provincial economy is for all to see and there is an urgency to address our future prospects.


Newfoundland is the victim of a vastly changed economic landscape, both locally and in Canada. The reliance on out-of-province employment has seen better days. God knows we don’t need more out migration. Better heads than mine will be seized with this, and we hope our politicians can cooperate in a unity of purpose to help make things better.


Oh me nerves!

    subtitles: "Artist Jeff Musseau in his tiny basement studio. - RENE J. ROY / WRECKHOUSE PRESS INCORPORATED",
    body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – It’s small, cramped, and cluttered beyond belief. Visible from any spot in Jeff Musseau’s basement studio/workshop are about 15 paintings, 30 artifacts from the local area that one might even call junk, countless frames, hundreds of paints and even an old school alarm clock. When you look around his 15-square foot studio, it’s rather amazing Jeff can get much work done in here. His canvasses are huge, some bigger than most dinner tables. But he makes it work, with easels in one corner, a framing table in the back, a couple of computers and an awful lot of canvas. 


The alarm clock is something Jeff found while out on a walk one day, and he hopes to incorporate it into an artwork in the near future. If only he can find the time as easily as he found the clock.  From his home in Mouse Island, Musseau says he has always had a strong attraction to art. He says that he “might not have won first prize in elementary school, but he always won the best colouring contests.”


Musseau is self-taught, having had no formal training whatsoever, which makes his ultra realistic work all that much more impressive. 


“I started out doing pen and ink. I loved that, and then I got into using oils.”


Oil paint was not something he enjoyed because of the time it takes to dry, as well as the strong smell of the paints. 


“Then I tried watercolours, and I couldn’t control it. Watercolour has a tendency to spread, so then I picked up acrylic, and I fell in love with it.” 


Off the top of his head, Musseau estimates that his self-training took him at least ten years. He has an infectious laugh, and is more than happy to discuss his evolution as an artist, although he refers to himself as a multi-media artist and not just a painter. 


“I guess I’m a one-stop shop. I’m a visual artist, a digital media graphic artist, a commercial artist, anything in that field.”


If he had to categorized his artwork, he’d say Realism. It’s easy to see why. Musseau’s paintings take usually him weeks, if not months, to complete. When finished, his canvasses look like a photograph. Every stroke of the brush is slow and deliberate, seemingly fully thought out long before he touches the brush or the pen to the canvas.


His studio is in his basement, but the painting he creates spends just as much time upstairs as Musseau does. He stares at it while eating a meal, or while watching television.


“The lighting up there is completely different, and I can see things that might need to be there.”


As for subject matter, Musseau tends to lean towards scenes of the outdoors, although anything that catches his eye is fair game for inspiration. 


“A lot of my style is that I see things that the average person might walk by, and I can see it as art. But a lot of it we are losing.”


As an example of what he means, he refers to old fishing flakes and wharfs.


“The old stages now are gone, every house is vinyl now. We’re losing all that, so I’m trying to capture as much of it as I can.”


Musseau is capturing so much of it on canvas and acrylic that he is building a studio on his house. The planned addition will not only display his work, but will also give the public an opportunity to come in, chat with the artist, and purchase any or all of the pieces he displays. 


Musseau’s artwork has been featured on the cover of Arabella magazine, Acrylic Works magazine, and hangs in the Ducks Unlimited offices, as well as in several coffee-table books about styles of artwork. This kind of high-profile prolonged exposure has helped to put his artwork in very high demand.


Clients will call him from just about anywhere, including right across Canada. They are either buying Musseau’s works or commissioning him to do something specific for them. Some of his pieces sell for as much as $8,000.


With Musseau being so busy, he keeps his fans involved in all of his projects with a newsletter via his website, and frequently puts a few “sneak previews” on his Facebook page.


It seems to tickle him to tease his fans with a quick five-second video of a huge painting, but it once again demonstrates how Musseau is a savvy entrepreneur who utilizes different forms of media to attract fans. 


He may be in high demand now, but Musseau first started out as a sign painter, “way back”. Most in the region have likely seen his work on the highway via the sign coming into Port Aux Basques. 


“That Shark Cove Suites sign is mine. Thats been there I’d say 15 years,” offers Musseau.

But the artist never really loved being a sign painter, and decided to move into original works, painting what he wanted and what he saw.


Musseau hopes to have his studio built by next summer, having already completed it in his mind’s eye. He easily envisions exactly how it will look, and he has someone lined up to help him with the professional style lighting that will be needed to display his artwork properly. 


“Right now, I come down here, and the lighting is terrible, so that’s why I take it upstairs, to study it,” says Musseau. “But when I get that studio built, I’ll have my office on top, and I can step right out into a brand new room with so much more light.”


If Musseau can get so much done now in such a tiny little basement corner of his home, then it should be pretty fun to see what he might accomplish in a full sized studio.",

    subtitles: "The old fish plant in Burnt Islands is slowly succumbing to the elements, but as it crumbles it is becoming an even greater risk to neighbouring homes and residents. - RENE J. ROY / WRECKHOUSE PRESS INCORPORATED",
    body: "BURNT ISLANDS – After a hard storm flung pieces of the derelict fish plant at Jim Baggs’ house last fall, he was obliged to use his homeowner’s insurance to repair the damage.

“My insurance took care of it and the adjuster asked I who owned the building,” recounted Baggs in early February 2021.


Baggs didn’t have a ready answer, but directed the adjuster to the previous owner.

“As far as I’m concerned, Roland King was the owner when it was opened. He had all the say into it. Once it went down, nobody owns it,” said Baggs.


Burnt Islands is hardly alone when it comes to the problem of what to do with crumbling fish plants. It is a province-wide problem, one which usually boils down to money.

Decades after the plants have ceased operations, they remain eyesores on otherwise picturesque communities, deteriorate into environmental hazards and, in the case of Burnt Islands at least, pose physical danger to nearby residents, their own properties and vehicles.

Not being able to determine liability means homeowners like Baggs are usually obliged to use their own insurance, and that can drive up their premiums and become costly. The problem isn’t going away anytime soon either, and seems likely become even worse as the structure deteriorates further.


Some towns, like Port aux Basques, are able to maintain their former fish plants, providing industrial rental space or selling them outright. For smaller communities like Burnt Islands, that’s simply not feasible or affordable, but the risk to nearby residents and their personal property looms large. To date no injuries have been reported, but how long can that good fortune hold?


“When all of that old aluminum starts to peel off of that...,” said Baggs. “That can come blowing at you boy, let me tell you.”


Wallace Kinslow is a town councillor who is feeling just as frustrated.


“If the Town of Burnt Islands could have gotten rid of that, that would have been gone,” promised Kinslow.


The town has successfully removed other derelict structures, and asked a contractor to assess removing the old plant. But without knowing who the owner is means it can’t be torn down, even in the unlikely event it proves affordable.


The councilor has also asked (MHA) Andrew Parsons (Burgeo-La Poile) for help, providing Parsons with photos and what information he could find. He’s also called the provincial department responsible for the environment about a leaky tank.


“They did come and take that out of there,” said Kinslow.


But other than the tank there’s been no real progress towards finding a solution.


“We’re to a stand still,” admitted Kinslow.


The councilor says the town’s main concern is for the physical safety of those living close to the plant. But there are other concerns as well. Boxes and piles of old records, paperwork and binders get blown outside almost daily. Nearby residents have been doing what they can to clean it up, but it’s not their responsibility. Once the roof collapses, the mess will only get worse.


The responsibility for those records does not fall on the federal government either, clarified Kevin Guest, Communications Advisor for Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).


“While DFO cares very much about the privacy of Canadians, protection of the records, including the purchase slips, are the responsibility of the former fish plant owners. In the absence of the owners, licensing of fish plants is a provincial responsibility,” stated Guest via e-mail.


“The documents provided to Fisheries and Oceans Canada to review appear to be company information as well as Fisheries and Oceans Canada purchase slips.”


Purchase slips are provided to buyers to record the sale of most fish, which is a requirement under the Fisheries Act. Each purchase slip has three copies, one for DFO, one for the buyer, and one for the fish harvester. Buyers must maintain their own copies, but these records do not contain sensitive information that would require DFO to intercede. 

The province has also stated repeatedly that it can’t afford to clean up all of these abandoned fish plants either. Add Parsons’ name to the list of those frustrated with the Burnt Islands fish plant.


“I’ve done everything I can do on it,” he said via telephone interview. “This is one of those evergreen issues. It comes up every once in a while when there’s a storm and something blows off it and hits somebody’s house.”


Parsons has helped deal with fish plant problems before, most notably in Rose Blanche-Harbour Le Cou and Isle aux Morts. The lawyer turned politician has also served as the province’s Attorney General and is well-versed in legislation surrounding liability and responsibility for derelict fish plants.


“It’s not easy,” admitted Parsons, who detailed the significant time and effort Isle aux Morts had to put in to resolve its fish plant problem.


After consulting his records, Parsons shared that he tried to help with the Burnt Islands fish plant in 2019 and in 2020. First among his recommendations was that the Town of Burnt Islands consult a lawyer to determine ownership and, if it’s a corporation, whether or not the company is still active. Until ownership is properly determined, not much can be done, including removal. 


“It becomes an age-old thing. The legislation allows a community to take certain steps to demolish a building, but the problem is that you end up spending a ton of money,” sympathized Parsons. “Most of these towns don’t have the money to do this kind of work.”


Neither does the province. Even if it could dedicate the funds to demolish all of the old fish plants, such an undertaking would still have problems.


“Then it becomes a question of liability,” Parsons pointed out. “Government will not, nor should they in my opinion, make a blanket exception to do something, because there’s a million fish plants around the province that are dilapidated.”


 Parsons also notes that even if an exception was made, that would just open the door to make the province and its taxpayers liable for similar problems that were, in fact, incurred privately.


“Where does it end?” he asked.


Some of the cost could potentially be offset via outstanding tax revenues. In May 2020, Council voted unanimously to write off $169,113.30 in back taxes still owing. Multiple questions about the situation were put to the Town of Burnt Islands, which chose to issue the following statement.


“Like many outport towns around the Province, Burnt Islands has a seemingly abandoned business related to the downturn in the fishery and it is quickly becoming a big eye sore for the Town. With reports of the old plant being raked over for anything of value, the building’s integrity is now posing a major safety issue for nearby residents. The Town has inquired several times through different government departments and our MHA on how to best handle the deteriorating property, but it is very apparent there is no easy and quick solution. The Town is led to believe that any attempt to rectify the situation is going to be a costly endeavour and one the Town cannot afford to take on. In the past the Town has dealt with much smaller properties in similar states in an effort to keep the town’s image as clean and welcoming as possible, but even these actions prove to be difficult for the Town to break even financially. It has been the council’s position not to place the entire burden on the town’s taxpayers, but feels it will take involvement from higher levels of government to actually see some movement. Burnt Islands is not unique here as our neighbouring towns are still having to manage similar situations. There are no easy solutions with such high-associated costs.”


Roland King is a former manager with the fish plant, but did not respond to inquiries as of press deadline. Both Eric King’s Fisheries Limited and Eric King and Sons Limited are currently listed as registered, active corporations in good standing under public provincial records.

    body: "Here’s what you need to know this week about the sports you love for the week of March 22, 2021.


NHL Noise

The April 12th NHL trade deadline is approaching, leaving teams with three weeks to decide whether they will be buyers or sellers. Let’s look at the deadline through a North division lens.


Sellers


The Ottawa Senators are confirmed sellers. The Sens are in a good place in their rebuild but still have unrestricted free agents (UFAs) that may be moved to contenders for picks and prospects. Forward Ryan Dzingel and defencemen Erik Gudbranson are noteworthy. 

 

Throwing the season will not be easy for the Vancouver Canucks following last year’s success. They eliminated the reigning cup champions before a second-round loss to the Vegas Golden Knights. But they will be sellers and UFAs Alexander Edler, the veteran defenceman, and centre Brandon Sutter, are trade chips. They’d love to offload a bad contract, but in this environment that will be like trying to sell fire to the devil. 


Buyers


The other five Canadian teams are expected to be buyers, and some will compete for the same players. By the time you’re reading this, some deals will already be done.


The Toronto Maple Leafs are looking for a top-six forward to strengthen what is already a powerhouse of a forward group. GM Kyle Dubas is on the record saying he is willing to trade a top prospect to get what he wants. 


After renovating their forwards earlier in the season, the Winnipeg Jets desperately need to improve their defence group. Connor Hellebuyck is an elite goalie, but the crew in front of him needs help.


The Montreal Canadiens needed a left-side defenceman before they loss Ben Chiarot to injury. A veteran centre is also on the wish list to support their kids and help in the face off circle. Fans want Bergevin to swing for the fences, but this time of year he’s usually fonder of small ball.


As predictable as Christmas, the Edmonton Oilers are looking for scoring wingers to complement their elite centres. They should also be looking for a goalie, but far be it for me to suggest their stellar model to date should be revisited.


The Calgary Flames – not good enough to contend and iffy to make the playoffs – should not be confident buyers. But they didn’t just fire a coach and hire old flame Darryl Sutter so they could enjoy regular season moral victories. They will be cautious shoppers for a top-six right winger.  


The Market


As is the case every trade deadline, some GMs have accepted their fate boldly and announced they are open for business. They will trade veterans for prospects and draft choices to rebuild for another window. I’m watching the Nashville Predators, the Anaheim Ducks, the New Jersey Devils and the Chicago Blackhawks, and expect significant trades for each. 


The other certainty of every season is a train wreck or two – the teams that have come completely undone and are left with few options but sell and try to get it right next time. Let’s call this crowd the door crashers. 


What in the name of Joey Smallwood is happening in Buffalo? A fired coach, a fortune spent on goal scorers that can’t score, and a miserable franchise player. The Sabres have some dandy pieces to move, but they’ll have to eat salary to make it happen. What would the Oilers give to turn James Neal into Taylor Hall with salary retained? 


Hockey in the desert has been a struggle since it was just a gleam in Gary Bettman’s eye, but this iteration is special. Last season the Arizona Coyotes traded for Taylor Hall and were in “win now” mode. Hall left, and a new leadership is installed and focused on restocking a cupboard low on draft picks after a combine testing debacle. Wouldn’t it be delicious to see Phil Kessel back in Toronto?


The Columbus Blue Jackets have become the mother of all train wrecks. Every week is a new episode of “Who’s Being Benched?” There is an apparent gaggle of available players. I wonder who will be next to try and make Max Domi a top-six centre.


Raptors Racket


The Raptors were hit pretty hard by the coronavirus and quarantine rules and are officially outside of the playoff picture as of press deadline. The argument to sell Kyle Lowry and Norm Powell at the March 25th trade deadline is gaining strength on the daily.


Blue Jays Babble


The Toronto Blue Jays open their season on April 1st against the New York Yankees, leaving Manager Charlie Montoyo 10 days to finalize his roster. On Wednesday, pitcher Thomas Hatch left the game due to discomfort in his pitching arm. He joins starting rotation hopeful Nate Pearson on the questionable health list. 

The starting pitching rotation will continue to be a story for the Jays until they are able make a trade, perhaps using chips from their crowded outfield. A best guess for starters is Hyun Jin Ryu as the ace, followed by Robbie Ray, Tanner Roark and Steven Matz. If healthy, Pearson will also be a starter. 


Spring is finally here folks. You’re probably excited enough to wet your plants.

    body: "Just because there’s a global pandemic doesn’t mean the winter fun has to stop. Roslyn Warren, Chair of the Margaree-Fox Roost Winter Carnival 2021 COVID Edition learned that other communities were hosting a virtual winter carnival so Margaree-Fox Roost decided to do the same.


“We’ve always had a winter carnival for the last 20-something years,” said Warren. “We figured we can’t do anything socially this year because of COVID.”


This year’s carnival ran from March 14 through March 21. The committee drew up a week-long agenda of daily activities and invited participants to share them on their Facebook page for others to see and enjoy.


Among the events were baking, St. Patrick’s Day outfits, snow sculpting, window decorating, and even a scavenger hunt to find things most people had in their homes.

Participants were also able to win gift card prizes, awarded at the end of the carnival. But there was no judging involved. Anyone who participated in the day’s events qualified for the daily’s draw.


“It seems to be going pretty well. It seems everyone is enjoying looking at the photos,” Warren said.


Warren says that future years may see a hybrid carnival where in-person events can also be done online.


“A lot of people, if they can’t get out, are just enjoying the pictures that people are posting. Maybe we’ll do a bit of both.”",

    subtitles: "The region’s COVID Committee meetings are currently scheduled for every second Friday at 3:00 p.m. and include a large number of stakeholders, including representatives from the Town of Channel-Port aux Basques. From left: Town Manager Leon MacIsaac, Mayor John Spencer, Town Clerk Julia Ingram. - SUBMITTED",
    body: "SOUTHWEST COAST – One year after the provincial government began implementing new measures to halt COVID-19 from gaining a foothold in Newfoundland and Labrador, the Southwest Coast has escaped relatively unscathed. There have been no large outbreaks here, merely rumours of a possible case or two. There is no queue-jumping for vaccinations, and residents have adapted to the new normal.


Some of that success can likely be attributed to the region’s COVID-19 Committee. The committee was initially formed at the Bruce II Sports Centre on a Sunday afternoon shortly after the province had confirmed its first case. In attendance were Town Manager Leon MacIsaac and Mayor John Spencer (Channel-Port aux Basques), (Dr. Charles L. LeGrow Health Centre) CEO David Palmer and Dr. David Thomas, Chief Medical Officer.


“The community was seeking direction in relation to its recreation facility. Hockey, figuring skating, bowling, the gym and curling were in full swing. It was decided at this meeting a recommendation would go to Town Council to cease operations at the Bruce II,” recounted Spencer via e-mail. “From there it was agreed to do a follow up, bring community and regional stakeholders together as the new cases surfaced within the province.”


Given the new and still-growing restrictions on gatherings and proximity, by necessity that evolved into virtual conferences involving multiple participants from around the Southwest Coast. These included municipal leaders, town clerks, representatives from Western Health, local doctors, MHAs, first responders, business leaders, church leaders, Marine Atlantic and the Canadian Red Cross. 


“For the most part, for over a year now, participation is still at a very high level,” confirmed Spencer.


The meetings are designed to be straightforward and simple, focusing on sharing of information. Usually that means an initial briefing by Dr. Thomas and Dr. Wendy Graham. After that David Palmer outlines the availability of services and impact of services related to COVID-19 at the local site. After that there’s usually a question and answer session to allow for other participants to offer input, followed by a quick summary of how things are progressing in each area or community.


Maurice Collins of the Salvation Army in Port aux Basques is involved with the committee through the ministerial association.


“Basically I update them on what’s going on with the churches, how we’re handling the recommendations and guidelines. I talk to them about what’s happening with the food bank, what’s happening with the (community) kitchen, and of course, feed the truckers was part of that as well,” said Collins. “With the team that was there, it was a pretty informative team, right from government right down to medical.”


Collins said the group came together well right well from the start.


While the initial goal may have been geared more towards preventing people from getting COVID-19, that doesn’t mean the committee hasn’t continued to adapt and grow as other issues came to the forefront as the pandemic measures have dragged on.


“In all matters it was critical to not only understand the physical but to understand the emotional and mental stressors and the impact on individuals and families,” noted Spencer.

As restrictions eased and then were re-instituted, committee members had to be prepared to answer questions about the minutiae of everyday do’s and don’ts.


“For example, individuals would seek clarification on regulations pertaining to requirements at each alert level. What restrictions needed to be in place and time frames involved?” wrote Spencer.


Sometimes the committee found itself taking a more pro-active approach rather than just sharing information. They had to be prepared to act if an outbreak should occur in this region.


They sought clarification from the province about rotational workers for Marine Atlantic, which had reported that a crew member on the MV Blue Puttees tested positive for COVID-19.


“Another action was related to seeking more direction from the province in guidelines for the operation of an emergency shelter with COVID restrictions in place. At a number of meetings the group was expanded to bring in guests to discuss issues impacting education, provincial responsibility for enforcement and established testing sites in the event of a surge in cases within area.”


Although the provincial alert dropped to Level 2 this past Saturday, that doesn’t mean the COVID committee can relax anytime soon.


Stated Spencer, “The committee’s role has not changed now that vaccines have started to roll out within the general population. The virus is still with us. The committee will continue meeting on a bi-weekly basis until this pandemic is beyond us.”",

    body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Three decades after it first began servicing the Gulf ferry route, the MV Leif Ericson is nearing the end of its tenure with Marine Atlantic. The ship is preparing for its 30 year survey and will be undergoing drydock and inspection in the weeks ahead according to Darrell Mercer, the Crown corporation’s Communications Officer.


Built in Norway in 1991 for Stena Line and originally christened the MS Stena Challenger, the vessel was purchased in 1991 and re-named the MV Leif Ericson in honour of the 1000th anniversary of his settlement in the province. The Ericson has the smallest capacity of the Marine Atlantic passenger ferries, and predominantly serves to transport commercial traffic across the Gulf of St. Lawrence.


It’s still quite early in the process, but Marine Atlantic is in the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of securing a new ship to add to its fleet with two proponents, Stena North Sea Ltd. and Rederi AB Gotland.


“We continue to work with Transport Canada regarding our future fleet configuration; however, it is anticipated that the new vessel will replace the MV Leif Ericson,” stated Mercer via e-mail.


“Similar to the process of introducing the MV Blue Puttees and MV Highlanders, Marine Atlantic will be chartering the vessel with an option to buy. The charter period will provide important information regarding the performance of the vessel for our service.”


Marine Atlantic expects the new ferry will enter service some time in 2023-2024. What will happen to the MV Leif Ericson after that has yet to be decided


“Decisions regarding future fleet configuration will continue to be discussed over the next couple of years,” wrote Mercer.",

    subtitles: "MP Gudie Hutchings’ recent vote against a motion to raise Old Age Security benefits drew attention from Southwest Coast residents on social media last week. - FILE PHOTO",
    body: "SOUTHWEST COAST – Given the continuous onslaught of price hikes for everything from gasoline to groceries to home repair goods and services, it stands to reason that those on a fixed income are struggling more than ever to make ends meet. Seniors are among those Canadians who have been hardest hit by the pandemic.


But on Monday, March 8, Liberal MP Gudie Hutchings (Long Range Mountains) was one of three MPs from Newfoundland and Labrador who chose to say “Nay” to Vote No. 62, a motion by Bloc Québecois MP Andréanne Larouche (Shefford, Québec) to increase Old Age Security (OAS) benefit by $110 per month.


The proposed motion that Hutchings opposed read, “That the House: (a) recognize that the elderly were most directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) recall that too many of the elderly live in a financially precarious position; (c) acknowledge the collective debt that we owe to those who built Quebec and Canada; and (d) ask the government, in the next budget, to increase the Old Age Security benefit by $110 a month for those aged 65 and more.”


The motion did pass successfully, 183 yays to 147 nays.


Responding to inquiries via e-mail last week, Hutchings released a statement that began, “I’ve heard from a lot of folks over the past couple of days regarding Vote 62, a motion proposed by the separatist Bloc Quebecois party. As my mother always said, the devil is in the details: Vote 62 was a motion without substance. Since it wasn’t actually a bill (connected to legislation) there was no money behind it and no plan for how to get the money for an Old Age Security (OAS) increase. The motion passed in the House of Commons, and yet this motion will not result in an increase in OAS payments to seniors because it isn’t tied to any legislation. It’s hollow.”


Hutchings clarified the difference between a motion and a bill in the House of Commons, noting that there is an important distinction that Canadians must understand.

A motion that goes before the House of Commons to be voted on may be successful or it may be defeated, but either way it receives no further consideration after that.


“Bills, on the other hand, must pass through several stages, and if the House agrees to a bill, it then becomes implemented as a law,” wrote Hutchings.


Larouche’s motion merely called on the government to consider increasing the OAS in the next budget.


“My voting no to this motion was absolutely not an indication that I do not support seniors receiving more in OAS,” wrote Hutchings. “I did not vote in support of the motion because I know that an increase to OAS payments is already in the works as it was an election promise our government made in 2019 and was reaffirmed it in the Fall Economic Statement (September 2020).”


Hutchings observed that the Federal government has provided financial support to seniors over the past year through various measures, including $1,500 in tax-free support for senior couples, an additional GST rebate payment, and increases to OAS to match inflation.


“Since the needs of seniors increase as they age, we remain committed to increasing OAS for seniors over the age of 75 by 10% (percent),” noted Hutchings. “And when I first was elected, we brought the eligibility age for OAS back down to 65, after the Conservatives had increased it.”


Hutchings said that, in her opinion, seniors and all under-served groups in Canada deserve more and recognizes that more change is still needed to fix OAS.


“In my years as MP, I’ve learned that some federal government programs, such as OAS, could do with changes to bring them into the 21st century and better suit the current state of Canada and Canadians. Because of what I have learned, I am among several Members of Parliament that are engaging in discussions around the creation of a guaranteed minimum income program in Canada. This will take time and hard work. There is still much to do and we all must work together to better our country and help each other move past the pandemic into a bright future.”",

    body: "Author Lawrence Sanders, who first came to prominence with more gory offerings such as the First to the Fourth Deadly Sins series, has since embarked on a lighter mode of mysteries with the Archy McNally series.


Archy McNally is a conceited, self-promoting, would-be playboy zipping around West Palm Beach in his red Mazda Miata, working for his father under the most respectable legal firm of McNally & Son. Archy, however, is not a legal eagle, having been expelled from Yale Law school due to a “streaking incident” as he explains it. Instead Archy is employed by his father’s firm to conduct “discreet inquiries” on behalf of the firm’s wealthy clients who are sometimes caught in compromising situations.


Despite these flaws and the world of wealthy privilege, if not outright snobbery, he comes from, Archy is still quite likable as a protagonist, helped no doubt by his sense of humour.  

In this installment of Archy’s chronicles, he finds himself embroiled in investigating the improbable and most inconvenient murder of a busboy, which happens during a lavish benefit party attended by the wealthiest of the Palm Beach society that Archy is attending on behalf of his illustrious father.


To complicate matters, Archy is also asked to verify the identity of a suddenly re-appeared heir to a vast fortune. Throw in a muck-racking journalist from the Big Apple, who pretends to be looking for an exposé of the decadence of the town, but is actually looking into a potential blackmail scheme, and soon the reader realizes that all of these little puzzles will converge into one giant mystery.


Despite the premise, Sanders has crafted a light-hearted tale without any gory details. Interspersed with Archy’s dalliances, present and past, are various love interests and a number of characters who are not who they are purported to be or where they were supposed to be at crucial times.


Through Archy’s extensive use of high-faluting language and overly quoted past witticisms, Sanders offers a glimpse into the world and minds of these scions of old money and that of the “nouveau riche”, including how they view the rest of the world, the poor plebes, if you will.


There is even an oblique reference to a real estate magnate purchasing Mar-a-Lago and being shunned by the local gentry. How many parallels do you need to envision former United States President Donald Trump as that character?


Of course, through some good luck, and with the help of a number of people he regards as his lesser assistants, Archy manages to solve these puzzles, but not without losing one more innocent person thanks to the misdeeds of the miscreants.

As for the identity of the newly-discovered heir to the fortune of a recently deceased dowager, we after a roller coaster ride Archy identifies the possible rightful heir. A missing toe points to his being exactly who he says he is, but there remains one tantalizing hurdle. The supposed heir is right-handed whereas the real person should be a lefty, and that alone is enough to alert Archy that something remains amiss.


In the end, not only is the would-be heir an impostor, but partly to blame for the demise of both victims. But to uncover the murderer(s), Archy, along with the local police department, has to gamble with the life a yet another potential victim.


In the end, Archy successfully solves the overall mystery and remains somewhat wiser but dissatisfied in matters involving his love life. Most importantly, however, he has satisfied his boss and father, the titular head of the McNally & Son legal firm. It’s another win for Archy, and for the readers who have accompanied him in Sanders’ fun little world.


I would give this book a strong 4.5 stars, and having read most of the McNally chronicles, I would not hesitate to recommend them all with a similar rating.

    subtitles: "Nellie and Cecil Elms.- SUBMITTED",
    body: "Nellie (Hatch) Elms first opened her eyes upon this world little more than one hundred years ago. One hundred years is an impossible amount of time to fathom. When looking backwards to the span of a century, time can seem to unravel like a spool of delicate, meandering thread. It stretches infinitely, beyond line of sight, journeying through periods of joy, laughter and loss, directly into a smaller, simpler time when the world was much less complex.


The term ‘village’ is not one used often here in Newfoundland. Yet it is the truest word to describe Stone’s Cove, Fortune Bay. Nellie was proud that visitors to this teeny settlement declared it a “pretty” place. It was, for Nellie, just that, and no grander words were needed to demonstrate her pride. That was Nellie, soft spoken and direct.


There exists a black and white photo of Stone’s Cove from this time. It proudly hung in Nellie and Cecil Elms’ home for the entirety of their lives, long after resettlement changed the face of Newfoundland shorelines. It shows a jumble of houses along a hilly escarpment, huddled together like a tangle of mismatched mittens tossed willy-nilly into a drawer. These dwellings face a deep, bottlenecked harbour, a place of safety and repose from unpredictable Atlantic seas. 


It was this tiny fishing settlement perched on the sea, that welcomed Nellie Hatch on June 8, 1920. We cannot know if the moon greeted her, or the sun. If the sky were a tumult of clouds or if it were blue. If the winds raged and whitecaps danced upon the water or if the world settled into calm and echoed with seagulls’ cry. We cannot know if her mother laboured long or if her infant came easily into this place.


 There is no record of Nellie’s birth weight or if she were graced with a full head of the downy hair that she declared to be a plague upon her in later years. Nor do we know her birth order – was Nellie the first daughter or the middle girl after her sister, Maggie? This we do know: Her birth made this world an infinitely more gentle place and ensured later blessings would rain down upon the life of her grandchildren.


Nellie’s family consisted of six children. Her father, George Hatch, died during his wife’s sixth pregnancy with his final daughter, Sadie. Nellie was a mere slip of a girl at his death but she talked of a long, bedridden illness.


The only picture George’s descendants own portrays a sombre, fair-haired man, unsmiling as was the fashion of photos from that time. He looks impossibly young in his crooked bowtie, but a kind softness seems to hide in his features, peeking out like a sleep-tousled child from behind a bedtime door. One can easily imagine his face broken by a wide smile on this day, one hundred years ago, and envision a mischievous pride that delights in Nellie’s arrival.


 His death left a widow and six small children in a time when survival necessitated the arduous work of both wife and husband. No doubt certain gut-wrenching decisions were made because of this hardship. For example, Nellie adored her brothers, Alan, Jordan, and Thomas, and spoke with quivering sadness of watching them leave for a Boys’ Home when times were especially tough.


Nellie’s mother, ironically named Charity, accepted none. Instead, she raised vegetable gardens, coaxing potatoes and carrots from rock-strewn hilltops, and goats for milk and flesh. Many the Stone’s Cove baby was feed with the milk raised by Charity. She also housed the community’s teachers and visiting doctors in order to feed her brood of children. Like other women of the era, she likely had a sun- speckled face and a proud, strong back, of necessity indomitable and no-nonsense – firm and unbending, like the sinkers along the shore.


 Nellie, like her mother, was no stranger to hard work. In early settlements all hands contributed to ensure the world kept turning. Nellie kneaded bread from the age that she could “just reach the chair”. Her bread was divine, although on at least one occasion she declared it had over-risen, and there were “holes big enough to lie down in” throughout the dough. Her laughter still echoes from that day.


Nellie learned early that you must “wring out your rag until it was almost dry” before wiping up the floor on hands and knees. As a small child, she heaved water to thirsty animals, drank goats’ milk and turned the fish with the women at the flake. Nellie was never one to complain – instead she shared these stories with pride and happiness. She sometimes wondered, though, if her mom were not just a little hard on her and if perhaps the lion’s share of the work fell to her instead of her sisters. 


Nellie Hatch and Cecil Elms were paired from a very tender age. While essentially children, they both knew, and the village knew, that they were destined for each other, the way sun is for sky and fish is for water. That knowing sustained them both – she the fatherless girl, and he, the motherless boy. It provided sustenance for the entirety of their lives. For nearly seventy years they loved each other and the family that they created with a bottomless and joyful love, unfathomable as the deepest abyss of sea. 


There are several things about Nellie that we know with surety. She loved Stone’s Cove. She knew its every path and rock and tree. Her grandfather had a long white beard. She was proud of her mother because her family was never hungry. She made the most incredible apple pies. She called each of her grandchildren “my pretty” on some occasion or another.  Her flower garden was a riot of vivid colour. When she laughed, she threw her head back and laid her open palm upon the listener’s arm or leg, whatever she could reach. She hated to miss “All My Children”.  She also hated her soft, downy hair and loved her husband, heart and soul. 


More than any of this, we know that Nellie was wonderful – everything that a mother and grandmother should be. Her heart held a quiet, gentle strength and her memory is treasured to this day.


Nellie Elms left this world on a May day filled with sunshine. Again, like sun is to sky and fish is to water, her husband, Cecil, followed her three days later.

    body: "Last Tuesday Mar. 24, I went to the Lions Club here in Port aux Basques, to join other first responders in the lineup for the first shot of COVID Vaccine. While it’s my intention to tell you how it went, to be honest, there’s not a lot to tell. 

Like you, I’ve heard all about the European countries that have banned or suspended use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and it made me more than a little worried to know that all first responders in the province would get this exact vaccine. But the fact of the matter is, there is absolutely no evidence that the shot I got last week (also called COVIDShield) causes any serious medical issues.


COVIDShield is the brand name in Canada for the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot. It is manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, and is biologically identical to the AstraZeneca vaccine. Millions of people have received at least one dose of the vaccine, and out of all those millions of people, there have been 37 cases of complications due to a Thrombosis (blood clot).


Most have been linked to previous medical conditions, or a genetic predisposition to susceptibility. It's considered an extreme autoimmune response to the vaccine, and is treatable. Of those 37 cases, only 11 people worldwide have had an issue directly linked to the vaccine, and the reasons why are still not exactly clear. So just based on the mathematical probability of complications, there is no reason to worry about getting a COVID vaccine. 

When I signed up to get my shot right away, I was warned by my family about the risks of clots, strokes, sickness etc. But to be exposed to a virus that can kill me, and my loved ones and my neighbours seemed to be more of a risk. Especially after I did some fact checking and learned after only 10 minutes of reading about the risks of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. 


The experience itself was so smooth I barely had time to finish my coffee before I was back in my car. 


The capable and welcoming medical staff asked me the standard questions we have all come to know and love, about exposure, symptoms and so on. That was really the
 only part of the morning that was familiar.  Heading into the little makeshift booth, I was seated, asked a few questions about allergies, and then the nurse pulled out a needle so large it looked like it was probably designed to tranquilize an elephant. 


Picking the right arm, she jabbed me with it, and surprisingly enough given the size, the needle didn’t hurt at all. I’ve had tetanus shots that hurt more. It was over remarkably quick. 

And then the nurse said, “Let me tell you about the side effects”


After I had the shot. 


I admit, I teased and picked on her a little bit for giving me the list of side effects after I was vaccinated, but in all reality, the side effects of the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot are pretty much the same as you might get after a standard flu shot. Sore arm, decreased appetite, sleepiness – all standard stuff. 


So I let the nurse off with a good-natured warning about telling me too little too late, and I was ushered to a waiting area to sit down for 15 minutes. The reason you have to wait is just in case you have any allergic or adverse reaction to the medication. 


I didn’t have any issues with reactions, other than a slightly sore throat later that same night. Having spoken with a couple of others who received the vaccine, it seems a couple had experienced some more unpleasant but temporary side effects such as sweats, headache, and lethargy.


That seems like a very, very small price to pay to make sure that everyone I know or may come into contact with either through work or socially are safe. 


Please get vaccinated as soon as you can, so that everyone can go back to one big bubble, so we can chat face to face and shake hands once again.


I hope to see you again, in person, real soon.

    body: "SOUTHWEST COAST – Everyone is familiar with the adaptations and sacrifices that comes with daily life in the COVID-19 world. Changes to commonplace routines like shopping, travel, parties and so on can make things complicated and hard to navigate. What is less frequently considered is the difficulty faced with the loss of a loved one in a pandemic world. 


Death is not something that most people carry in the forefront of their mind. However, in the new every day that we are faced with, it is something that has been impacted in ways that may not be immediately evident. 


Jim Morris and Colin Osmond of East Haven Funeral Homes have witnessed those changes. Morris says that its painful to have to explain to family members that they might not be able to visit a loved one who has just passed away. 


“It’s not very good. They might not understand why all the family can’t come because of all the restrictions that might be in place.”


It can be more than visitation numbers that are affected as well, says Osmond. 


“Over the past 12 months we have seen drastic changes, whether it be a traditional earth burial or a traditional cremation service. I think it’s a direct result of the restrictions we’re currently under, and I don’t know if it's going to change anytime soon.”


The changes that Osmond is referring to are directly related to the alert levels in Newfoundland and Labrador. 


At the most restricted Alert Level 5, funeral services are limited to no more than 5 people, and this total includes the officiant. Public visitations and wakes are completely prohibited. 

At out current Alert Level 2, those restrictions on wakes and visitations are not mentioned, and services may have up to 50 people. This is relatively new, as the guidelines for Level 2 have just been amended. 


Over the last year, the province has run up and down the level scale rather often, with Level 5 being first instituted on Feb. 10, 2020. 


One thing that Morris and Osmond have noticed over the past 12 months has been a steady rise in the number of cremation services.  Newfoundland trends toward traditional burials over cremation services, with cremation usually making up about 30 percent of services. 

Over the last few years that percentage has risen to almost 50 percent according to the Cremation Association of North America. 


Osmond explains, “This past twelve months, we have seen a very steady and noticeable increase in the rise of cremation services. I feel it has to do with the COVID restrictions. I mean, how do you sit down and tell a family that due to government regulations, that they can only have a certain number of people to come view their loved one?”


“It’s a big change,” admits Morris.


The end result might be felt a year from now, says Osmond. With travel restrictions across the country impacted by bubbles and outbreaks, travel has never been more complicated or more difficult. 


During the level 5 lockdown, for example, travel into Newfoundland and Labrador was severely restricted even just within the Atlantic provinces.  This can pose enormous stresses on family members who are trying to return to attend a service, or be with relatives during an already stressful time. 


Morris says that they have seen more cremations now than they ever have, and also believes it’s likely a direct result of the pandemic. Being able to have friends and family join you at a later time, when restrictions are fewer, is an opportunity to grieve together in the way that can be lost under a restricted service. 


Father Andrew White of St. Anne’s Parish in Millville agrees. Speaking solely from his experience as a clergyman and an officiant at services since coming to the region, he has also observed a number of changes.  


“Even at gravesides, we were only allowed to have five people,” he begins, referring to the Level 5 restrictions. “And that was really, really sad to see. It was very heartbreaking for the people, such as a person who couldn’t pray for her mother at her funeral.”


Fr. White has taken the initiative of live-streaming services for those bereaved family members who might not be able to attend, either due to limits on gatherings, or due to travel difficulties. 


Limited by poor WiFi or internet service at a number of locations, from La Poile to Coal Brook, Fr. White has adapted by recording the services and distributing it as requested should that be necessary.  He has also observed that a service that might once have been a burial service is now a cremation service. 


“Under COVID, cremations have noticeably increased. Noticeably,” he states.


When asked if he feels that cremation is on the rise to aid a family in the grieving process, he nods his head.


“Because of the difficulty in travelling, instructions are being sent home to some, to get them cremated to allow time for the family to return home. They don’t know when they will be able to get have a funeral. So it’s leaving families very uncertain.”


Fr. White touches on a common concern among service officiants, saying that a delay in funerary services has an impact on families more than once. 


“It creates a lot of problems, because you’ve lost them once. Now you’ve got to go through that again.”


Its the proverbial double-edged sword agrees Morris.


”Mentally and physically it’s very draining. You don’t know what to do. What can you do?” he asks rhetorically.


Reverend Jane Allen says she has had similar experiences ministering to her flock at St. James Anglican Church in Port aux Basques.


“It’s such a big challenge. There are people who have – let’s say 10 children – and their spouses. That’s 20 right there. With officiants and pallbearers, music choices and choir, you could be down next to nil for family right away.”


Osmond and Morris have had their share of the impact of having to follow guidelines. Having to deny visitations or similar traditions takes an emotional toll on them as well. 

Osmond confesses that he has gone home after work feeling terrible about the news he has had to give grieving family members.


“Being able to only see their loved one for 10 or 15 minutes,” he says, “It weighs on you at night. It’s such an emotional toll knowing that we have to enforce these laws.”


Until COVID-19 is in the rear view mirror, rules and regulations surrounding funeral and church services will continue to adapt, to say nothing of families who have lost loved ones..

Says Fr. White sums it up succinctly.


“For Catholics, a funeral is both a celebration of life, as well, we believe in praying for the dead – that we can still do good for those who have died. Our funerals do both. For people to go through this over and over again is sad and difficult.”

    body: "Here’s what you need to know this week, March 29, 2021, about the sports you love!


NHL Noise

With the April 12th NHL trade deadline just two weeks away, trade chatter is picking up. Just when you think all eyes would be on Mattias Ekholm, described by Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman as “the belle of the trading ball”, Tim Peel inserted himself. Peel, the veteran referee known for inserting himself at all the wrong times, had his future freed up on Wednesday. 

Peel was reportedly due to retire after this season and was scheduled to call his last game on April 24th. But after being caught on a hot microphone admitting to his intention to call a penalty early against the Nashville Predators, the NHL announced that Peel “no longer will be working NHL games now or in the future.” An early retirement without a cake is something, but I wouldn’t hold my breath that the zebras are suddenly entering a new era of accountability. 

The Predators were expected to be major trade deadline players, but their playoff picture has become murky. Pending unrestricted free agents Mikael Granlund and Erik Haula are expected to be on the move, but the guy at the eye of the hurricane is Mattias Ekholm. A solid all-around defenceman is on the wish list for a gaggle of teams including the Montreal Canadiens, the Winnipeg Jets and the Boston Bruins. 

Another team to watch is the Anaheim Ducks. Like the Preds, they have kids who are emerging, and veterans will be moved to build for a new window. Ryan Getzlaf is the UFA to watch and GM Bob Murray has acknowledged to Hockey Insider Pierre LeBrun that he has to take an open mind into trade discussions. The Toronto Maple Leafs have been connected to Anaheim’s Rickard Rakell.

The Habs were expected to start the dominoes this week. A week of cancellations due to two players being added to the COVID list seemed like an ideal time to focus on a trade, but it takes two to tango. As of press deadline, it was quieter than a graveyard. 

Canada is trying to help things along with an announcement on Thursday that they were about to approve a 7-day quarantine with additional testing for NHL players being traded to Canada.


Raptors Racket

The Toronto Raptors woke up on March 25th, the NBA trade deadline day, with a record of 18-26 and in 11th place in the Eastern conference. That made them sellers, and the focus shifted to whether Kyle Lowry and Norman Powell would still be Raptors at 3 p.m.

These questions were answered in the early afternoon when Powell was dealt to the Portland Trail Blazers for Gary Trent and Rodney Hood. Trent is a 22-year-old shooting guard/small forward who was a second-round pick in the 2018 draft. Hood is a 28-year-old shooting guard/small forward who was a first-round pick in the 2014 draft and joins the Raptors in his eighth year in the league. A good young player and a solid defender is not a bad return for a player on an expiring contract. 

Shortly after the Raptors traded three-point specialist Matt Thomas to the Utah Jazz for a second-round pick and right before the deadline, Terrence Davis was sent to the Sacramento Kings for another second rounder. Both deals were believed to open roster spots for additional players in a potential Lowry trade.

Then the deadline came and went and Kyle Lowry remained a Raptor. Ultimately, they loved Lowry more than they loved the offers they were getting for him. Happy birthday Kyle.


Blue Jays Babble

On Thursday afternoon you can watch the Toronto Blue Jays open their season against the New York Yankees. Let’s make a stab at what the Jays batting order might look like.

Your leadoff guy should have a high on-base percentage and be worthy of the most at bats for the team. Newly acquired George Springer is expected to be the regular to bat leadoff for the Jays, but a recent injury may throw a wrench into that plan for opening day.

The second hitter should also be reliable hitter, and in this spot it’s also good to have a guy who can run and steal you a base. Bo Bichette looks like the favourite for this spot.

Three other positions look fairly secure. The catcher of the day, whether Danny Jansen or Alejandro Kirk, will likely bat ninth in the order. The other positions are clean up man and fifth batter. Both guys need to be able to hit for power and bring runners home. For me, these positions will fall to Teoscar Hernandez and Vladimir Guerrero Jr., and it’s a toss-up who lands where.

That leaves a collection of decent hitters to bat third, sixth, seventh and eighth, and they will be determined each game based on who is pitching, who needs a rest and how they play the field that day. Rowdy Tellez, Lourdes Gurriel Jr., Marcus Semien, Cavan Biggio and Randal Grichuk will fill in the gaps in the batting order. 

If the Jays struggle, it won’t be because of a weak batting order. Batter up!

Among the topics discussed were more efficient methods of snow removal and initial plans for the municipal election this fall. Here are some of the highlights.


Snow clearing tips

Greg Sheaves appeared as a delegate to offer some advice to Council about more efficient ways to clear snow that might also result in saving money by speeding up removal efforts following a winter storm. Sheaves, who has 42 years of experience, spoke about a dump site plan, how to build a ramp when clearing snow to avoid getting stuck or resorting to an excavator, and how operators can avoid back tracking.

“Never travel with a half a basket and you see it over and over,” offered Sheaves. “Never double-handle snow. You’re paying double wages, burning double fuel, and wear and tear on the equipment.”


Lights out

The burnt out street light at Legallais that has almost resulted in a pedestrian-vehicle collision on more than one occasion was scheduled for replacement on Thursday, Apr. 1. The light at Hilltop Lane has also been replaced. A list of other areas that still require maintenance has been sent to NL Power, and Town will continue to follow up. Lighting issues at the weigh scales are also on Council’s list of areas. Town Manager Leon MacIsaac is working with the province to have those fixed.


Causeway cost

Shoring up the Grand Bay West causeway is expected to cost $7,500. Wind and sea erosion is taking its toll and new armour stone is needed.

 “It is washing away there,” admitted Mayor John Spencer.


Canadian Cancer Society

The Canadian Cancer Society (CCS) sent a letter requesting support since traditional fundraising methods have not been permitted. Council noted that it receives far more requests for financial support than it can possibly fulfill. Council voted instead to support the Ronald McDonald House and the Daffodil Place as it does every year.

“You’re still supporting the same cause. It’s just more locally connected,” observed Coun. Justin Blackler.


Gravel gone

Residents of Forseys Lane have asked Council to replace the gravel road that has washed away or been plowed down and now threatens to expose buried sewer lines. Town last put new gravel down in 2019 and Public Works will visit the area first to take a look before fixing it up again.


Municipal election details

Town will continue to have separate elections for Mayor and for Council. The election has been scheduled for Sept. 28 and there will be no advance polls, although proxy voting will be permitted.

The nomination period is currently scheduled for Aug. 30 to Sept. 3, and there will be one full day to submit nominations, lasting from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. on the appointed day.

It is anticipated there will be a need for 12 Deputy Returning Officers and 12 Poll Clerks for each of the polling stations, and extra staff may need to be required to sanitize the stations for voters depending on what COVID-19 protocols remain in place this fall.

A mobile voting station for those in long-term care homes or with mobility issues will also be made available, as it was during the last municipal election. Town Clerk Julia Ingram and the Alternate Returning Officer will be passing out those ballots.

During the 2017 Mayoral contest, Spencer claimed victory by only 4 votes, but over 10 votes there’s a financial cost for the candidate requesting the recount.

“Anything over 10, there will be no (automatic) re-count,” Ingram told Council.",

    body: "Dear Editor,


I was very interested to read the article about the recent vote on a motion to increase OAS by $110 per month because I was surprised to see our MP, Gudie Hutchings, vote against it. I was even more surprised when I found out that only 3 Liberal MPs out of 149 voted for it. After reading the article, I was even more upset because of how incomplete some of her answers were.


Regarding the motion itself: It was a private member’s motion, which is the main way opposition members bring forward ideas and issues. They’re either called resolutions or orders, depending on what you want to do with them. This entire motion (Vote No. 62, Sitting No. 68, March 8, 2021) is as follows:


“That the House: (a) recognize that the elderly were most directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) recall that too many of the elderly live in a financially precarious position; (c) acknowledge the collective debt that we owe to those who built Quebec and Canada; and (d) ask the government, in the next budget, to increase the Old Age Security benefit by $110 a month for those aged 65 and more.”


Ms. Hutchings is correct that it’s not tied to any legislation, but it’s not tied to any legislation because no private member’s motion can contain provisions for raising or spending money, unless it’s worded as a suggestion. If this particular motion were made into a bill (or if it wasn’t worded as a suggestion), it would need a royal recommendation, which you can only get through a Minister. It is unlikely that MP Andréanne Larouche would have had the minister’s sign-off, in part because it was brought forward by a member of the opposition, and because according to Gudie in the article, there was a Liberal plan in the works to increase OAS for seniors over 75 by 10%.


This alternative idea from the Liberal party is significantly less beneficial than the motion in Vote 62. The current maximum OAS rate is $618.45 per month. A 10% increase would mean an additional $61.85 per month – only 56% of the proposed $110 increase in the private member’s motion and restricted to recipients over 75 instead of all OAS recipients.

Now that the motion has passed, it is considered “an expression of the opinion of the House” and further legislation can be built upon it, creating a bill. This motion was only the first step of several to increase OAS payments. I hope the remaining steps go smoothly, and with a stronger vote than 183 to 147!


The final Nay count was 147, 146 of whom were Liberal MPs. Of the NL MPs, 3 voted Yea to increase OAS by $110 per month (NDP MP Jack Harris, Liberal MPs Ken McDonald and Churence Rogers) while 3 voted Nay (Liberal MPs Gudie Hutchings, Seamus O’Regan, and Scott Simms). The other Liberal MP to vote in favour of increasing OAS was NWT MP Michael McLeod. All other parties (NDP, BQ, Greens, and Conservatives) voted in favour of the motion, along with 3 out of 4 independent MPs.


“…we remain committed to increasing OAS for seniors over the age of 75 by 10%”

Vote No. 62

Sitting No. 68 - Monday, March 8, 2021

That the House: (a) recognize that the elderly were most directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) recall that too many of the elderly live in a financially precarious position; (c) acknowledge the collective debt that we owe to those who built Quebec and Canada; and (d) ask the government, in the next budget, to increase the Old Age Security benefit by $110 a month for those aged 65 and more.

Hence, such motions which simply suggest that the government initiate a certain measure are generally phrased as follows: “That, in the opinion of the House, the government should consider …”. The government is not bound to adopt a specific policy or course of action as a result of the adoption of such a resolution since the House is only stating an opinion or making a declaration of purpose.


No private Member’s motion can contain provisions for either raising revenue or spending funds, unless it is worded in terms which only suggest that course of action to the government. As an alternative to a bill which might require a royal recommendation obtainable only by a Minister, a private Member may choose to move a motion proposing the expenditure of public funds, provided that the terms of the motion only suggest this course of action to the government without ordering or requiring it to do so.

    subtitles: "Graham Philpott and Christa Stacey during their trip to Prince Edward Island in May of 2018, where Stacey stumbled upon an intricately carved gold ring (below)and embarked upon a quest to return it to the rightful owner. - SUBMITTED",
    body: "Christa Stacey had never been to Prince Edward Island with her fiancé, Graham Philpott. So in May 2018 the couple decided to go over to the Canadian island tourist destination for a weekend getaway together.  What was a spur of the moment trip ended up being an incredible experience to remember for the Port aux Basques couple.  Philpott, a former resident of Prince Edward Island, took Christa to see several locations, and they ended up choosing to visit some of the beautiful local beaches. 


“We stopped at Cavendish, around lunch time I would say,” recalls Stacey, “and I took a couple of pictures at the beach, we went for a walk, and on the way back, the sun was really bright, and I could see something shining on the boardwalk.”


When Stacey walked closer to the bright object, she realized it was a solid gold ring. She scooped it up.


“It looked like it was hand carved. There were intricate carvings into it, and I’d never seen a ring like it before. It looked really interesting.”


Christa and Graham approached the other vehicles in the parking lot, thinking perhaps one of the other beach-goers had lost the ring, but nobody laid claim to it. 


“I felt that there was something special about this ring – that whoever owned it should have it back. To me, it didn’t look like a souvenir or store-bought ring. It just looked so special.”


Christa’s next step was to post about the ring on various lost and found groups of P.E.I. through Facebook. 


“So I did that, and didn’t have any luck, so I put the ring away, and thought, ‘Well I’m going to continue to look.”


Anyone who uses Facebook is familiar with the Memories feature the social media platform offers. On the anniversary of your postings, Facebook sends a little notice reminding you of past posts and prompts you to share it once again.  On the anniversary of Christa’s original post about the ring, it popped up on her timeline once again, reminding her that she still had the ring in her possession. 


“So I posted it again, and no luck,” says Stacey. 


No luck is not entirely accurate. Stacey was told that the ring looked like it came from British Columbia, resembling something called Haida art. She began to research the style, and identified the etchings inside the ring.


“Missy xxoxo Dad”.


This time, she shared the lost ring in all of the popular provincial Facebook groups, right across Canada.  She still wasn’t making any headway, so she then made the decision to contact CBC, to try to get more exposure for the lost keepsake. They readily agreed. 


“By Friday night (March 26), her sister had seen the story.”


When Stacey says her sister, she is referring to the sister of the ring’s owner, Melissa.

Melissa Greene lives in B.C., and she lost her ring 11 years ago. She has never been to Prince Edward Island in her life.   Meanwhile, Christa was contacted by someone else who had seen the story, and informed her that the ring looked like the work of Thomas Greene. Thomas is a respected Haida carver, and a known maker of jewelry.  Stacey sent him a photo of the ring, asking if it was in fact his work. 


“Before I heard back from him, she (Melissa) had contacted me, and said ‘This is my ring!’”


Verifying that Ms. Greene was indeed the proper owner was easy. Melissa sent several photos that clearly showed her wearing the ring, and displaying it proudly.  That left no doubt in Christa’s mind that she had finally found the owner after almost three full years of searching. They spoke a couple of times over the phone, and Christa learned a lot about the history of the ring’s journey. She declines to delve into that part of the tale.


“That’s not my story to tell,” she chuckles. 


The ring is especially cherished by Melissa, explains Christa.


“Of all the rings and jewelry she has from her father, that is the only one she has made of gold. Everything else she has from him is silver.”


Ms. Greene never thought she would see the ring again. 


“She didn’t know if it got melted down, or what happened,” shares Stacey. 


Christa sent the ring back home to Melissa just last Wednesday, March 31. 


 “I’m pretty excited for her to get it back,” says Stacey. 


After a three year long search, to have found the owner of a treasured keepsake makes Stacey happy beyond words.


“It’s amazing. It was just very emotional for me, when we were reaching out to each other, talking on the phone.”


But the mystery remains unsolved. How did such a treasured piece of custom jewelry end up on a boardwalk in a province its owner has never visited?",

    body: "Dear Editor,

‘A mandate to lead based on failed opportunity to lead by others’. 

The provincial election results, seeing the Liberals hang on to power by a slim majority, was the result of failed leadership. It was about the failed leadership of the Conservatives and the NDP.


Both party leaders lost their respective seats. Both party leaders failed to follow the wisdom offered by the late NL Premier Joey Smallwood.


”The first lesson for anyone seeking office is to work hard to be elected. The first task upon getting elected is to work harder at being re-elected.” 


On the latter both the Conservative and NDP leaders failed miserably. 


Kudos to our own MHA (Andrew Parsons). Constituent and provincial leadership of the highest degree, thus the vote of confidence. The interest of the district always in the forefront on the floor of the House of Assembly.


However, one would be remiss if recognition and congratulations was not offered to Perry Trimper in Labrador who, against what appeared to be difficult odds, rallied to shake off the dust to once again serve the interests of his district as an independent candidate, now re-elected MHA.


Forgiveness is an all inspiring virtue.


Lastly, John Abbott. His candidacy is to be commended. The conviction by this individual to lead NL during the Liberal leadership race that resulted in the coronation of Andrew Furey has been rewarded. John Abbott campaigned in a NDP stronghold, the seat held by its provincial leader. His victory overcoming what must have appeared to be insurmountable odds is an inspiration to anyone seeking office.


“It ain’t over till it’s over.”(Yogism 101)


Anxiously now awaiting the tremendous one/two punch that NL has at the helm.

The Province is in good hands. NL strong!

    subtitles: "Now that he has reclaimed his seat, MHA Andrew Parsons (Burgeo - LaPoile) seems eager to get back to work. Prior to the election Parsons also served as Newfoundland and Labrador’s Attorney General and as the Minister for Industry, Energy and Technology.",
    body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Now that Andrew Parsons has reclaimed his seat as MHA for the riding of Burgeo-La Poile, he’s mostly just trying to get back into the swing of things.


“I’m just trying to get caught up,” he says via phone interview, a day or two after the election results were announced.


The Newfoundland and Labrador Liberal Party claimed a slim majority, winning 22 seats in the House of Assembly after a prolonged, 10 week election. Parsons first won his seat in 2011 and has served as its MHA ever since, as well as handling several high-profile portfolios under various Liberal leaders. He was re-elected by a significant margin, earning 1992 votes to his nearest competitor, PC candidate Ethan Wheeler-Park’s 235 votes. NDP candidate Judy Vanta earned 60 votes.


Parsons does not yet know if he will retain the portfolio as the Minister for Industry, Energy and Technology (IET) while also serving as the province’s Attorney General, but says he is happy to serve in whatever role Premier Andrew Furey would like.


“There’s normal, and then there’s this. Normally after an election, it’s still about a two-week process before members are officially elected. That’s statutory,” explains Parsons. “So generally, sometime within the next two weeks, you will see the House open for Members to be sworn in, and for a speaker to be elected, and at some point prior to that you usually have the cabinet appointed by the Premier.”


Parsons says that he’s not aware of the specific timelines for that process and whether or not they will be altered given the pandemic, but he does expect he will have to return to St. John’s sooner rather than later as the government resumes. In addition to re-opening the House, he anticipates the government will move quickly to pass an interim supply bill.


“That’s the bill that goes into the House that ensures the bills are paid until the budget is passed.”


How long it will be before the Liberals will announce a budget is not a question Parsons can answer, but he says at least the interim supply bill will ensure that civil servants, for example, continue to get paid. He concedes that it’s been a different kind of election this time around.


“There was nothing normal about it, prior to February 13 or after, everything about it was different,” says Parsons. “Every part of it was different, including the meetings and the strategy and the campaigning.”


He credits his seasoned teams for their ability to adapt and evolve during an unusual campaign.


“Overall, obviously, I’m extremely happy with the results. I got a strong showing of support here in the district, which pleases me to no end, and it just lets you know your hard work is paying off.”


While Parsons may be secure in his riding, the election process itself has come under heavy fire from party leaders, the general public, media and political scientists. Although Parsons comes from a legal background, he has no experience with election laws, though unofficially at least he says that he has spoken with some friends and colleagues who do have that background about a challenge to overturn the Liberal victory.


 “Right now it’s just extremely hard to tell,” says Parsons. “I think it comes down to each race. Will you see something that takes the election in its entirety? I don’t think that will happen, but if you look at some of the districts maybe there will be some action brought, but it’s hard to tell.”


Until he returns to the House, Parsons is more focused on ongoing matters within his own riding. He’s already resumed holding virtual meetings and teleconferences with community and industry leaders.


“There’s a lot of stuff in my district and my former department – it remains to be seen where I go – but what was going on in the department does have an effect here. I was just on the phone again with Matador Mining,” shares Parsons. “That could have a huge, positive impact on our district.”


Matador has already resumed work on its Cape Ray gold shield. In addition to more jobs, the company’s presence also helps boost tourism operators who offer temporary accommodation rentals and food services. Tourism has taken a particularly hard hit thanks to COVID-19 lockdowns, and Parsons says he is keen to help out local operators.


“We are very contingent on a strong tourism season here,” notes Parsons.


Naturally any talk of tourism must include Marine Atlantic, the Crown corporation that serves as the region’s largest employer.


“There’s a lot of interesting things going to be happening there,” offers Parsons. “Even though it’s not provincial, I obviously think we all have a vested interest in it and I plan on following up on a number of different issues there, whether it’s the ferry, whether it’s COVID restrictions, whether it’s cost recovery, whether it’s headquarters, you name it.”


Ideally Parsons would like to see Marine Atlantic relocate its headquarters to the Port aux Basques area. The ferry service is currently headquartered in St. John’s, and was once based in New Brunswick. A sign across the street from the Bruce II Sports Centre in Port aux Basques denotes where Marine Atlantic had planned to build a new facility that would consolidate its regional operations under one roof, but so far no construction has begun.


“Every time I drive by that stadium and see that sign up there,” Parsons pauses before continuing, “put it this way – the irritation never goes away. So there’s no doubt that that is something that needs to happen.”


Parsons says that like everyone else, he just wants the best Marine Atlantic possible.


“We depend so much on it,” he says. “I also don’t think it’s Marine Atlantic per se. A lot of what they do is driven by the Federal government, so there’ll be lots of questions asked to the Federal government on the decision-making process.”


Parsons also plans to speak to the Federal Minister of Transport, Omar Alghabra, about cost recovery.


“I think it concerns me in both of my roles. I think it concerns me as an MHA and I think it concerns my role as it relates to industry.”


Discussion around cost recovery has started to get more attention in Ottawa after MP Jack Harris protested against recent ferry increases, with some calling for the provincial government to challenge the practice in court as a violation of the Terms of Confederation.


“That’s been an age old conversation. It’s not one that I have looked at recently,” admits Parsons. “We all know that there’s the Terms of Union, and then there’s the interpretation of it.”


Parsons would rather try to find a solution through co-operation between both levels of government, noting that Alghabra is new to the portfolio. Nevertheless, he concedes that so far advocacy and diplomacy has failed to resolve the matter of cost recovery, despite federal campaign promises to do just that.


“There is absolutely an argument to be made, but whether that argument would be successful in court is a whole different question, because I will say that the Terms as written, there’s a vagueness to them.”


For now cost recovery seems to be on the lower scale of pressing concerns. Parsons points out that the two levels of government still have to deal with a number of other matters, including rate mitigation, oil and gas and healthcare. Keeping cost recovery nearer the forefront will take more time and effort.


“This is one that I don’t think generates a lot of attention in Ottawa, which is why we need to ensure that we do our part to ensure that the Department is quite aware.”


He may not currently helm the IET portfolio, but Parsons remains committed to developing future economic opportunities for the province and most especially his riding. One of those includes the cold and live storage feasibility study for Port aux Basques.


“There should be something coming back on that within the next 30 days,” shares Parsons. “My understanding is that it’s in the conclusion (of the) timeline now, where if it’s not done it’s about to be done.”


Aside from economic development, Parsons says the biggest part of his job remains day-to-day issues. That can mean long hours for Parsons and long-time assistant Joanne Clarke, helping residents navigate provincial departments, whether it’s wading through red tape or just getting answers.


“That’s what we do. That’s the biggest driver of our job. I also think it’s the biggest driver of why we’ve been successful, is that we really put our heart and soul into trying to help people.”


Parsons also plans to deal with funding issues and infrastructure in the region. Although his plate may be full, he says he’s just truly happy to have the opportunity return to the House and deal with all of them.


“There’s still a lot of conversations to be had.”

    body: "Here’s what you need to know this week about the sports you love!


NHL Noise

It looked like the April 12 NHL trade deadline would become much ado about nothing, but then Montreal Canadiens GM Marc Bergevin broke the ice with the first significant trade leading up to the deadline. The Habs sent 3rd and 5th round draft picks to the Buffalo Sabres for veteran centre Eric Staal. 

The Sabres retained half of Staal’s salary to make the deal work. Bergevin has now stockpiled six players who have their names engraved on the Stanley Cup, and you can be sure those guys are not in Montreal to be collectibles.

A day later the Canadiens added a goal scorer when they signed Cole Caufield to his entry level contract. Caufield was the Habs first round pick (15th overall) in the 2019 draft and is expected to be a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award, given to the player voted best in NCAA Division I men’s ice hockey. Caufield will report to Laval following quarantine but will doubtless get a look in Montreal before the regular season ends. To make that happen, Bergevin will have to clear some cap space, so the wily GM is not done yet.

On Tuesday, March 30, the Philadelphia Flyers placed defenceman Shayne Gostisbehere on waivers. At noon on Wednesday, he cleared. 

“The Ghost” is just two seasons removed from a 37-point campaign, and three seasons from 65 points. But his game has suffered since Alain Vigneault became head coach in 2019 and brought with him Talent Whisperer Michel Therrien. Ghost comes with a $4.5 million cap hit for two seasons after this. 

The Flyers, in the meanwhile, have been labouring like a sloth on a treadmill, and are in tough to make the playoffs. It was speculated that that placing Gostisbehere on waivers was an attempt to clear cap space in anticipation of a big move, perhaps to add a goalie with Carter Hart also struggling. Nothing had materialized as of press deadline. 

The Habs and Flyers are not the only teams tight to the cap. In the North division, the Leafs, Oilers and Jets would all like to add talent for a playoff run but will need help on the salary cap to swing a deal.

Several teams are strong options to make a trade and absorb a bad contract, including the Detroit Red Wings and the New Jersey Devils. In the North Division, the Ottawa Senators are sellers who can weaponize their cap space at the deadline.

The Sens are in last place in the division and have several UFAs that will be of interest to teams, including Ryan Dzingel and Erik Gudbranson. But they also have significant cap space and hope to be able to land some assets that come as sweeteners from teams hoping to offload bad contracts.

Suppose Montreal, looking for a depth defenceman, wanted Gudbranson. Suppose they were willing to offer a 5th round pick, but then Ottawa agreed to take the Paul Byron contract in return. Does that 5th then become a 3rd? Or Perhaps a prospect is added?

Similarly, what might Philly be willing to offer the Sens to take Gostisbehere? What if the Oilers wanted Dzingel for scoring help, and the Senators were willing to take James Neal in return? What would Edmonton be prepared to add to be free of that monster contract?

In a flat cap season, cap space becomes an asset. By the time you’re reading this, a deal or two of this ilk may already be done as teams look to clear space in advance of April 12.


Raptors Racket

After a drama filled trade deadline, the Toronto Raptors are adjusting to a new roster and still struggling to find their game. Questions remain about the future of Kyle Lowry, and the Raptors are hoping they can string some wins together and make the NBA play ins. 


Blue Jays Babble

The Toronto Blue Jays opened their season with a series against the New York Yankees, and this week will face the Texas Rangers and the Los Angeles Angels. The first couple of weeks will be the calibration period for a roster with significant new additions. The Jays also had a couple of players dealing with minor injuries – George Springer (oblique) and Robbie Ray (bruised elbow) are most noteworthy. 

We have learned some things from the NHL adapting a baseball-style schedule for this season. It’s a good idea to not get too high or too low based on one series. In baseball, we wait for a few teams to come and go before we have a real sense of how our team matches up.

The Jays may be tested early by injuries, but this is a young core ready to take the next step. As baseball icon Yogi Berra once said, “Baseball is ninety percent mental. The other half is physical.”
