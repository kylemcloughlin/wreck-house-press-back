   title: "On the bookshelf: Becoming Autism Friendly by Anne Laurie",
  subtitles: "",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body:  "It takes a special town for people across Canada to pack up their belongings and move to a town of 4,000 people, on the southwest coast of Newfoundland and with no traffic lights. This is Channel-Port aux Basques, the first accredited officially accredited autism-friendly town.

The story of Autism Involves Me is a prime example of the old saying “it takes a village to raise a child”. This book quickly acknowledges the lack of support most towns and cities have when it comes to supporting children with autism. However, it also highlights the power and effect of change that can occur when a couple of people have a vision mixed with a passion to better their community turning it into a whole-community effort. They started small with passion and commitment that made their entire town turn heads and want to help to make their town as inclusive as possible. Every effort they made was a victory for the community. In the end, the town understood that children with autism did not have to fit into society, but society itself had to be re-designed for the children.

This book dives into a unique look at local businesses such as bookstores and restaurants and reveals how their intentions of being autism-friendly succeeded. It also provides you with the necessary resources to become more aware of autism and support your town towards autism-friendly accreditation. This book is as heart-warming as it is resourceful since it provides roughly 30 pages of resources and guides that will appeal to community members, parents, children, teachers, support workers, grocery clerks, and hotel owners alike on how we can all be more inclusive for individuals with autism. These guides, from checklists to discussion questions not only help us understand the “what” of autism” but the “how we can do better”. I read this book in one sitting, but I know I will be consulting it again and again for myself and friends.

On one hand, you get to know community members and their hearts for changing their town. One the other hand, you get an excellent grasp on how to make small and big changes for all individuals, both neurotypical and autistic. You finish the book not only feeling like you are part of the community, but you feel more prepared to support children with autism.
I was drawn to Joan Chaisson, the Director and Co-founder of Autism Involves Me. Her special touch was she not only cared for the children but their parents alike. I was left wanting to know more about her. I felt she had more to teach us about her approach to community engagement and getting people to consistently say yes to her. She is mentioned in a few chapters, but I could feel her hard work in every chapter as the backbone of the movement.

I had two questions throughout this book. The first was, “What happens when these children become adults? Will they find solid employment?” Autism Involves Me argues that it is a challenge for all towns and cities including their own to find fulltime employment for adults with disabilities. While the book did not provide a direct answer, I hope the supporters of Autism Involves Me will delegate resources to this cause.
My second question was, “What about children with disabilities who are not autistic? Are they receiving support? This was somewhat answered in chapter 8 from a speech-language pathologist who reminded us that there are children who do not have autism but have special needs, such as down syndrome, need just as much community support. This is a reminder that while we champion for one group, we need to elevate other groups as well. I am left to assume that since the town is quite educated when it comes to the differences and needs of individuals with autism, they are also well-equipped and compassionate enough to support individuals with other disabilities.

I highly recommend this book to all community members, schools, and businesses. All of us can learn a little that can have large effects and this book demonstrates this. Channel-Port aux Basques was never on my radar of “places to visit” but if I one day have the privilege to step foot in Newfoundland, I am certain I will take any detour to see the town for myself.

  title: "Salvation Army serves again",
  subtitles: "The Port aux Basques branch of the Salvation Army fed meals to provincial fire crews battling a week-long blaze in the Codroy Valley region. - © Bert Osmond",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "The Salvation Army has once again stepped forward to provide food for those passing through in service of the Southwest coast, this time bringing food to provincial firefighters as they battle the forest fire that has, to date, burned over 90 hectares near the Overfalls area in Codroy Valley. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when only tractor trailers were venturing on and off the island, volunteers with the Port aux Basques branch of the Salvation Army provided free meals for weeks for the truck drivers.

Corps Officer Maurice Collins explained that the meals are prepared in the new, restaurant grade Salvation Army kitchen by volunteers before being transported by car up to the firefighters.

“We’re met outside the fire area itself by their supervisor. The supervisor takes it and brings it in to the firefighters,” said Collins via phone interview.

Collins estimates that his volunteers are currently feeding a little over a dozen firefighters, including the helicopter and water bomber pilots.

The plan to feed the firefighters supper and extra water came about after the Salvation Army reached out to the Codroy Valley Volunteer Fire Department and soon received confirmation that the fire crews would welcome the offer.

Other members of the public have also reached out to provide raw goods for the meal preparation, but Collins says not everyone is yet aware that the Salvation Army is stepping in to help the firefighters.

“We just put it on Facebook last night. I’ve had quite a response to that of course, and we’re not soliciting donations at all. It’s just that people have dropped them off.”

It’s still unclear how long the blaze may last and how long the fire crews will be on site, but Collins touches base with them every morning to confirm the number of firefighters he’ll feed that evening. As usual, the Salvation Army volunteers are just happy to help.

“They’re really appreciative of what we’re doing for them.”",

  title: "Matador Mining makes progress",
  subtitles: "Gold nugget. - © Dave Varabioff / Pixabay",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – Matador Mining, the Australian corporation that is developing the Cape Ray gold mining project in the Southwest coast, provided an e-conference update to that project to members of the media, town council and staff on Monday morning, Aug. 17.
The corporation revealed that it has 12 million dollars to continue exploration this year and next year of the 120 km of Cape Ray shields. The robust project is expected to last for roughly 10 years and produce 10 million ounces of gold.

Although the company operates out of its Perth, Western Australia office, presenters Ian Murray and Keith Bowes say they have brought back many of the same people from last year.

“We have identified all the people needed from the island to make the team.”
Companies from other areas like Gander and St. John’s are also involved in the development.

Last year the company performed field work and some drilling to determine existing resources, but estimate that so far they have really only explored 15 km of the Cape Ray shield, which they have broken down into separate sections for future testing.

The company is also examining what a processing plant would look like in the region, including the mining area, with an eye towards developing what the representatives called a pathway to production. That could even mean demolishing the existing camps to build a new one centered around the gold mine, the run-off area, tailings pond and more.

Also on the To Do list for the company is just getting the permits, licenses and approvals it will need.

One of the hurdles they must face is environmental assessment so as to protect the native flora and fauna. Studies will include potential impact to fish and fish habitat, large mammals such as caribou, birds, surface and groundwater, and even atmospheric study of any noise or lighting and how it will impact the area.

Gold mining involves usage of contaminants such as mercury and cyanide. A buildup of effluent at one of Hope Brook’s holding ponds in the Southwestern part of the province was responsible for the mine’s shutdown in May of 1991, and Matador Mining intends to avoid any possibility of a similar incident.

Giovanni (John) Sferrazza, who is the President and Senior Project Manager for the Environmental Applications Group will help Matador Mining navigate through the environmental part of the project. He said that he was on site to talk to stakeholders directly and make sure they are part of the discussion.

The plan is designed to ensure that the drilled water is properly captured and won’t leach into streams or groundwater, where it can impact flora and fauna, or even end up in the ocean and affect the fishery. He advised that at some point the company may have three drill rigs on site.

Currently Sferrazza is working with the province to determine the exact guidelines the mining operation will have to follow, and that the environmental process itself can take anywhere from three to five years.

“We are in Year 2,” said Sferrazza.

Once the federal and provincial government’s environmental guidelines have been met, the company will host public meetings to address any other concerns.

“We cannot start the project until all agencies approve,” noted Sferrazza, and once that happens the company can focus on permits.

The company has already held consultations with various stakeholders including outfitters, special interest groups and indigenous communities, and will continue to work with the public to mitigate concerns.

Sferrazza believes that the timeline to submit the final environmental assessment at the federal and provincial levels will like take until the end of August 2021, provided the company can take home enough data from this summer’s exploration to put together all of the information required. Under questioning from a member of council, he stated that a realistic date for the beginning of construction is mid to late 2023.

Other questions from various attendees revealed that the preference for a holding site would be near the ferry to ease transport to the site. The plan is to buy products locally and provincially, but the company will still have to bring in specific materials from outside the province.

Port aux Basques council has offered to provide the company with a list of all services and buildings that the town has to offer.

“It would be invaluable,” replied Sferrazza.

Another update on progress of the Cape Ray mining project is anticipated to take place sometime this fall.",

  title: "Vardy's island removal begins assessment",
  subtitles: "A rainbow appears to touch Vardy's island. The tiny island in Port aux Basques harbour is being tested to determine if it can be removed, so that Marine Atlantic and other vessels will have an easier time navigating into port. - © Rosalyn Roy",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "The Port aux Basques harbour might be undergoing a facelift some time in the future. Verdys island has been used to launch celebratory firework displays for years, but that might soon have to change if Marine Atlantic and the town get their way.


“Vardy’s island removal is in the works. In the beginning the town sought ownership for the eventual removal. This is now in the hands of Marine Atlantic. Marine Atlantic in partnership with the town will be seeking the eventual removal of the island,” wrote Mayor John Spencer via e-mail. “Basically it is in the data collection stage before proceeding to the environmental stage before the actual removal occurs. It is all part of an overall harbour improvement strategy to allow for Marine Atlantic vessels to enter and leave the harbour in weather conditions considered less than ideal with the size of vessels and wind conditions. Many of the trip cancellations are prompted by safety in navigating the tight space within the harbour. The whole project will be done utilizing federal funding.”


Heavy equipment was spotted on Vardy’s island only a few weeks ago. 


Marine Atlantic’s corporate communications officer, Darrell Mercer, confirmed that the Crown corporation is proposing the removal of Vardy’s island to improve the navigational elements of the harbour, enhance safety and lessen the impact of challenging weather conditions.


“As part of this process, we are undertaking preliminary due diligence to investigate the geological and environmental aspects of the island,” wrote Mercer via e-mail. “We are currently drilling three holes on the island to understand its rock composition. This preliminary work will help us better understand and prepare for additional work and study should we progress to a future stage of removal.”


The drilling work lasted two days and was conducted by CBCL Ltd. using subcontractors. The next step in the process is to send the samples for detailed analysis, but Mercer cautions that it is premature to put any time frame on the island’s removal or even to know that it is truly possible.


“There is much due diligence that would have to take place involving various stakeholders. We are currently in an initial research stage to understand the geotechnical composition of the island.”",

  body: "There are certain things we all know. We are all of us, aware of unwritten rules, such as a Captain going down with the ship. 


But there are also unwritten rules governing how we all make purchases or contribute to someone’s work. One example is waiting to purchase something before taking it home from the store. 


When it comes to the newspaper industry, we have our own set of guidelines we all try to follow as well. For us here at Wreckhouse Weekly, we adhere to these rules as a matter of policy.


This can sometimes become quite a challenge just due to the nature of our business. We have to remain impartial and unbiased no matter the topic we are covering or the people involved. We have to offer everyone an equal opportunity to speak and, at the same time, temper that opportunity with discretion. 


It is not the policy of Wreckhouse Weekly – nor most news publications for that matter – to allow an article to be previewed by a member of the public ahead of publication. This would be irreparably damaging to the integrity of the article and remove the impartiality that we strive to maintain. 


We understand that sometimes you just want to know what lines we have selected from your interview to be in the paper, or perhaps you just might want to look at the photograph we took. But the reality is that if we allow even one person to oversee a step in the publishing of an article then our integrity has been compromised. 


Moving forward, we will continue to provide the entire Southwest Coast with honest, unbiased and completely impartial news.

  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "Launching a newspaper in the current market could be considered madness.

A study by the Local News Research Project estimates that over 250 Canadian news media outlets have closed between 2008 and 2019. Advertising revenues are down as businesses turn to online instead of old-fashioned print media, and mass layoffs of journalists and support personnel by media conglomerates have become routine. The golden era of newspapers is long gone.

And yet...

Independent, locally owned newspapers aren’t just surviving in Canada, they are thriving. The Discourse has delved in depth with fledgling startups from a half dozen provinces to find out exactly why and how, and their findings show that success comes from a commitment to and an almost exclusive focus on local content.

Smaller, hyperlocal papers have found an advantage in exploring stories that larger urban newspapers routinely ignore, such as a focus on municipal council activities or debates about which small town roads will see its potholes repaired each summer and which ones won’t.

That kind of coverage may not matter in a big city market but recent studies have revealed that it matters a great deal more to rural communities.

A whopping 92 percent of respondents to a Ryerson University poll consider community news to be important, and 69 percent consider it very serious if the decline in news reporting results in less local reporting. Similar polls conducted by various groups also support this data.

This is hardly new information, but it has perhaps been forgotten and is only now being rediscovered.

Back in 1967, teacher Evelyn Currie launched this region’s first newspaper which eventually became The Echo. Eventually it got absorbed by a media conglomerate, rebranded, and then sold and resold until a few months ago when the region’s only newspaper finally shuttered its doors.

By then it had no local staff reporter, no local sales representative and it was not being produced locally, though to be fair this had always been the case.

Some lamented its closure, others didn’t and still more pointed out that the newspaper had become irrelevant altogether because of social media and its long dwindling focus on community events and citizens. Who needs a newspaper when you have Facebook?

Here at Wreckhouse Press Inc. we believe that you do.

There are certain inescapable facts when comparing social media to newspapers, which is much like comparing apples to oranges. On the surface they’re both tasty fruit, but beneath the skin they are wildly different.

Anyone can post anything on Facebook and claim it as fact. Whether it is or not is irrelevant for the platform’s purposes, and in fact the more sensational the post is the more attention it is likely to generate.

Social media lacks checks and balances.

You can post a meme on Facebook, watch it catch on like wildfire, and sit back and enjoy the likes or simply the attention of those calling for your head.

There is no editor to drag you, head bowed, into their office demanding to know where in tarnation your facts are to support your outlandish conclusions. Or demanding you get the other side of the story, to speak to all parties involved and dig down to the core of the truth. There’s also no editor to make sure you remain impartial, that you are focused on the community you serve or that you mind the devil, who is always lurking in the details.

Speaking of details, if you’re going to have a local paper focused on local contents, then it stands to reason that the owners should be locals familiar with the area they’re serving.

The Wreckhouse Weekly’s owners are Port aux Basques natives. Their father was a French teacher from Québec who married a woman from East End Channel. They might have grown up in different provinces, but they spent every summer in Newfoundland and relocated back to their hometown eight years ago after realizing big city life no longer suited them.

“I took my son to visit his ancestors at one of the local graveyards, and he grew quiet and introspective,” offers the Wreckhouse Weekly’s new Editor-in-Chief, J. René Roy. “People think newspapers don’t matter anymore, but I would argue the opposite. Over a century after they were born, my ancestors and their lives and what they did and who they were proved so important to my son that the neighbours and I spent hours telling him stories. There were no newspapers back then to properly document their lives or the town, and no Facebook to share a memory about something that happened a couple of years ago. When I am gone, my grandchildren and theirs can look back at not only what I did, but how this town was and learn about the people that lived here.”

A little known fact is that René has experience as an editor, serving as a freelance ghost book editor for various independent authors. As an avid, exacting and critical reader, editing comes naturally to him. He also has training and experience with printing and photography, and has worked as a freelance photographer and delivery agent. You can send your Letters to the Editor to René at rjroy@wreckhousepress.com. 

For his sister, Rosalyn Roy, reporting is also nothing new. She served as the community reporter for two years previously, and since leaving that job she has written two books and is almost finished her third. She also has over two decades of experience as a graphic and layout artist and will be responsible for designing the advertisements and laying out the paper for printing.

“It’s been pointed out to me by previous editors that I spend far too much time just chatting with people I’m trying to interview instead of grilling them, but I make no apologies for that,” she said. “How can I present their point of view or understand where they are coming from without first getting to know who they are and why something matters to them?”
You can send your story ideas, tips and advertising artwork to Rosalyn by emailing rroy@wreckhousepress.com. 

The Wreckhouse Weekly’s salesperson is Thelma Dominey, who hails from Isle aux Morts and has family roots anchored in Grand Bruit. She has experience in sales and office administration with a previous local newspaper.

“I love getting out to talk to people and I like the challenge of sales. It’s important that people know where they can buy local or that a store can order it in so they don’t have to drive hours each way to get something. If I can bridge the gap between retailers and customers to buy local, that just helps the local economy and works to keep jobs in our area.”

You can reach Thelma to discuss advertising opportunities or copy and binding services by emailing her at tdominey@wreckhousepress.com. 

So here we are, three locals starting up a community newspaper focused on local content covering South Branch to Rose Blanche-Harbour Le Cou and LaPoile. We have some experience, some ideas and a lot of hope. This will be hard work and there’s times we’re going to stumble or trip. We ask for your understanding and your help and your guidance.
You can call us crazy if you like.

Just send us a letter, message or text to let us know what you’d like to see in your community newspaper, because it really is your newspaper, your stories and your legacy.
We just work here.",

  title: "Music Row: featuring Gordon Cromier",
  subtitles: "",
  author: "",
  body: "CODROY VALLEY – Gordon Cormier is a much beloved stalwart on the East Coast Music Scene, particularly on the West Coast where he still resides in his native Codroy Valley.

Cormier has been performing since early childhood, onstage at age 4 or 5 at the Chignic lodge.


“I remember in Grade 1, one of the nuns picking me up and taking me out and sitting me in the chair in the hallway and going back in and getting my accordion and said, ‘Now play for recess,’” laughs Cormier. “Music has always been my heart and soul.”


Cormier figures he plays around 17 different instruments, but the accordion was his first love. His latest instrument is the pedal steel guitar and he’s also got a 24 channel state of the art mixing board on the way so he can continue to record music from his home studio for himself, other bands and individual artists.


“It’s a hobby for me. Music is more of a hobby now. I still love to get out and play with the band.”


The band is called The Breeze Band has been together for about a decade and tends to perform mostly for fun, although they did perform at last year’s Strawberry Festival in Deer Lake. 


One of the fiddles in his studio once belonged to his great uncle, Johnny Archie MacDonald.

MacDonald bequeathed the fiddle to Cormier in his will because of one particularly memorable visit to the Cormier home. When MacDonald went to pour a cup of tea, Cormier grabbed the fiddle and started to play.


“I had never picked up a fiddle before but picked it up and started playing a tune called Cock of the North,” recalls Cormier. “He said he’d never seen that before.”


Music runs through the Cormier clan as effortlessly as water flows through the Grand Codroy River. His mother was a MacArthur and that clan has a similar legacy. Cormier’s niece is Mallory Johnson, who is currently being managed by famed country musician Sammy Kershaw.


“When you grow up and it’s all around you, you can’t help but play.”


The family’s music group, The Cormiers, have toured around North America and their achievements include 6 MUSICNL awards and an ECMA (East Coast Music Awards) 2008 nomination as Group of the Year. Gordon Cormier has also performed as a solo artist for the past 35 years and he shows no signs of slowing down.


“I’m putting together a virtual jamboree,” reveals the entertainer. “The festivals are cancelled this year because of COVID-19 and everybody’s hurting because of that, because there’s no live music, and not only the people that love live music are missing that, the musicians are missing having that place to go play and share their talent.”


The Codroy Valley has held an annual folk festival for years, where Cormier not only performs, but also helps run the sound system. With that on hold for 2020, he came up with the idea of the jamboree not only to help musicians and their fans reconnect but also in support of the Minnie White Museum.


White, who passed away in 2002, remains a legendary figurehead and inspiration to Newfoundland and Labrador musicians. During her career she was awarded the Order of Canada, appeared on television programs such as On The Road Again, was inducted into the Newfoundland and Labrador Arts Council Hall of Honour, and was nominated as Instrumental Artist of the Year at the 1995 ECMAs.


The 2020 Codroy Valley Virtual Jamboree will take place on Facebook and YouTube likely nearer the end of August. Cormier wants to keep the focus on the valley area musicians, which he estimates to number around 70 or 80 performers.


“I’ve gone around and videotaped already quite a few different artists,” says Cormier. “I’m up to about 30, 30 or 35 that are in there already, and it’s going to run over a 2 or 3 hour span.”


Viewers will be invited to donate, with half of the funds going to the museum and the other half to the musicians themselves. 


“They normally don’t get paid and they never ask to get paid,” says Cormier. “I’m always looking at ways to push new talent, new music.”


He says many of the musicians have already told him they don’t want to be paid and to put their share of any donations towards the museum instead. Cormier believes the virtual jamboree has the potential to become quite large.


His personal Facebook page where he performs live for one hour on Saturday nights has earned him new fans from around the world, including a lot of the United States, Europe and Australia. He plans to switch his performances to Wednesday evenings soon though. Cormier just hopes the featured musicians will earn some new fans of their own.


“If we’re going to draw people to this area, not only Codroy area but all the way right to Rose Blanche, we need to make more awareness of what we have to offer.”


In a way, COVID-19 has helped Cormier to focus on finding new, original ways to promote valley musicians while still pursuing his own passion. Were it not for the pandemic, he doubts he would have come up with the idea for the virtual jamboree.


“Music has always been my life. It’s not what I do. It’s who I am.”

  title: "MHA Andrew Parsons on new challenges",
  subtitles: "MHA Andrew Parsons (Burgeo - La Poile). - submitted",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – On July 20, Minister of Fisheries and Land Resources Gerry Byrne announced a $100,000 feasibility study to determine live holding, cold storage and transportation at Gander Airport and Port aux Basques for fresh and live seafood products destined for national and international markets.


MHA Andrew Parsons (Burgeo-LaPoile) says he played only an indirect role, and notes that with Marine Atlantic’s ferries docking in the town harbour, it only makes sense to include Port aux Basques in the study.


“There’s only two ways to get it out – by boat and by air,” said Parsons via phone interview. “They’ll do the feasibility study now, which I’m extremely confident will come up positive.”


Parsons says that part of his job is to ‘help nag’ to keep the process moving forward, especially since the reality of COVID-19 has already resulted in delays.


Parsons says the feasibility study, which will likely entail a Request For Proposals (RFP), will determine what would be necessary in terms of physical structures, human resources, and the cost of all materials involved to run such a facility. He hopes to work with government and the town to make the holding facility a reality, which would eventually lead to more jobs to this region.


He concedes the process may be slower than usual.


“Things are naturally delayed. Then you throw in the collapse of the oil industry in many ways. You look at the very extremely frightening, in my opinion, fiscal update that came out of it,” observes Parsons. “In my opinion, it’s going to take a lot of work.”


Heading up the provincial Liberals in undertaking that work will be new party leader Andrew Furey. Parsons has been vocal in his support of Furey. The two have known each other for around a decade.


“This signals to me a new beginning, and like all new beginnings they’re exciting because there’s potential, there’s opportunity,” says Parsons.


But while the MHA may support Furey and be excited for change, he offers a reality check regarding the massive challenges facing this province.


“As much as I support Andrew Furey,” says Parsons, “I think people need to recognize there’s no silver bullet or saviour that’s going to come in and fix this. It requires absolutely everybody and that’s not just elected politicians. I think it’s time for everybody to be cognizant of the situation we’re in.”


Part of that situation involved rethinking how he interacts with the public. Parsons has consistently been an approachable and accessible public servant, but he finds himself now confined to video conferences, telephone calls and emails as opposed to getting out in the district he serves.


“It’s difficult to be a politician because you’re expected to be so outward and shaking hands and slapping backs and kissing babies as they say, and that’s gone.”


If there’s a bright side, it’s that he’s never been more accessible electronically. In some cases, he’s found meetings and video clips more efficient than driving 45 minutes down the coast to tackle projects or problems in person.


“We’re just so used to being so friendly,” he says. “It’s tough because you go around half the time feeling you’re being rude or awkward or don’t know how to be.”


But Parsons says his role as Justice Minister is more suited to remote work.


“I don’t need to be there in person for every decision,” says Parsons. “That’s just the nature of that department. I don’t need to be sitting there at a desk in St. John’s to be effective.”


On a personal level, Parsons admits that his family is dealing with heightened immuno-compromisation in his own household, and like every other parent, he’s also wondering about the resumption of the school year in September before conceding he feels a bit of anxiety.


“I’m like everybody else. I watch the news and wonder about the second wave,” says Parsons. “There’s so many things to consider.”",

  body: "It may not be the usual summer season for Marine Atlantic thanks to COVID19 restrictions, but the ferry service has adapted to ensure that their passengers adhere to provincial and federal guidelines. Summer residents and out of province workers facing challenges to return to Newfoundland have drawn both provincial and national media attention.


What has earned far less notice is the installation of new ticket booths at the Port aux Basques terminal. Currently the Crown corporation is using a combination of both the old and new booths, depending on the volume of traffic.


“This isn’t a regular summer season for us and traffic volumes are much less than we would normally be experiencing,” offers Darrell Mercer via email. Mercer is the Corporate Communications Officer for Marine Atlantic. “When traffic volumes are high, the old booths are processing commercial traffic and the new booths passenger vehicle traffic.”


All of the new booths can handle both passenger and commercial traffic. Even with lighter volumes, just having two sets of booths entering the terminal space is taking a bit of adjustment.


“We are dealing with some space issues regarding the location of the CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) inspection station which does impact some of the booths,” concedes Mercer.


For its part, a media representative for the CFIA clarified that vehicles will continue to be processed as usual at the inspection shed.


“The quarantine inspection station will continue to be used as it is currently and there will be no changes to the onboarding process from a CFIA perspective,” clarified an agency representative via email. “The location of the Marine Atlantic ticket booths does not impact CFIA’s operation in Port aux Basques. The inspection of equipment and vehicles leaving Newfoundland and Labrador will continue to occur at the current quarantine inspection station.”


The CFIA established inspection stations in 1968 in Port aux Basques and in Argentia in 1979 to mitigate the risk and and spread of Potato Wart (PW) and Potato Cyst Nematode (PCN). Potato Wart was first discovered in Newfoundland and Labrador in 1912, while Potato Cyst Nematode was detected in 1965.


Potato wart is a fungus that renders potatoes unfit for human consumption, while the potato cyst nematode is a roundworm pest which feeds on its roots and can cause a crop yield loss of around 60 percent.

  body: "The world has certainly changed, and our small corner of it hasn't been untouched by the pandemic that affected so many parts of our lives. 


It has only been a month or two since The Gulf News and some of its sister papers decided to shut their doors indefinitely, yet it feels like it was a decision that had been coming for quite some time. It was probably around the middle of summer that we at Wreckhouse Press decided to team up and start a new paper. 


You may notice some things are very different than what you are used to.


Gone are the big federal and worldwide stories that you can get everywhere online or on TV. We feel that people who are local need news that is local. That is what matters to us, and we think it's what matters to you. 


Instead we want to offer you information that has an impact on your daily life and our communities, events that are local, and news that is relevant and specific to all of us. 


We also want to bring back some things that were popular in the past but have been absent for quite some time. 


We are talking coverage of local sports, puzzles – heck we might even do a community calendar. We are new to you, and our goal is not only to inform you but to entertain you.  


Gone are the days of news being printed outside and shipped here. This paper is 100 percent locally owned and operated. We want to create jobs locally and create buzz locally. 


We run the Wreckhouse Weekly out of our home.


We are new at running a newspaper, but we are not new to the business. All of us here at Wreckhouse Weekly have a history with the newspaper business and plan to draw on that experience to bring you back to an important resource in any small community – a truly local newspaper. 


I want to thank you for supporting our endeavour, and I welcome any suggestions you may have on content you want to see in the Weekly. While we can’t promise to put in every idea we are asked to, we will try to accommodate and interact with all of the communities we serve, from South Branch to Rose Blanche-Harbour Le Cou and La Poile. 


At the very least, we plan to do our best.",

The town office has remained accessible during COVID19 and is now open to the public with our own guidelines in place. Ongoing repairs to our water system and roads are continuing and we try to maintain a positive attitude as we move forward in 2020.


We have many venues that are not open this season unfortunately, such as the Lodge, Kinsmen Centre, our church and the Rose Blanche Lighthouse site. However, please feel free to still visit our community and walk our beautiful scenic trails while still maintaining social distancing measures. We have much to explore. 


The local store, D.J.’s Convenience, is still open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Our local playground is open, with cleaning and sanitizing occurring daily.  


We welcome our seasonal residents that have been granted exemptions to come here. However, please keep in mind the rules and regulations that our province has put in place to keep the curve flattened. 


Finally, to all the residents of Rose Blanche-Harbour Le Cou and Diamond Cove, we thank you for respecting all the rules and regulations that have been put forth by the province and local businesses. By following the guidelines you all have helped keep the curve flattened in our little community.

The birth of a new media outlet within our community during this pandemic is great to witness. To publish a new local newspaper in the midst of so much uncertainty socially, politically and economically speaks volumes for its creators. Communities need local news coverage and Wreckhouse Weekly will fill this void.


As a community, our role will be to support such an initiative. The foundation of any community across this great nation is small business. And now another small business in Port aux Basques has opened its doors.


Port aux Basques supported its first newspaper 53 years ago. It will do so today.


Symbolically, Wreckhouse Weekly is published across the street on Lillington Avenue in the shadows of the home of the late Mrs. Evelyn Currie, the co-founder and co-editor of our first newspaper, The Echo. It is wonderful to see a commitment to local news events back on our streets.


A sincere welcome and congratulations to Wreckhouse Press on your first edition.

  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The Channel-Port aux Basques Volunteer Fire Department is anticipating delivery of its new four door pumper truck in late September according to Fire Chief Jerry Musseau. The department had been applying for an upgrade to its 30-year old pumper truck for the past eight to ten years and was granted approval by the provincial government last spring.


The last time the fire department got a new truck there was a ceremony at the fire hall, but with COVID-19 Musseau concedes that is unlikely to happen this time around. He also doesn’t know if the town’s annual Christmas parade, which is hosted by the fire department, and where Santa and Mrs. Claus ride the pumper truck, will even be permitted to take place this year.


Over the summer, the fire department also hired five new firefighters to bring its complement back to its usual 35-member crew. Usually the fire department runs a two-day defensive training program sometime in the spring, but because of the pandemic regulations that training has not yet been completed. Musseau hopes to get the new recruits through the program before the new truck arrives.


“They’ve got to spend two full days – one day in the class and one day in the field,” says the Chief. “Now that we’re down to a Level 2, we’re hoping in the next little while to get that done.”


Until recently, the firefighters weren’t even allowed to enter their own fire hall unless they had to roll out for an emergency and they had to suspend their regular training. In order to protect against possible Coronavirus transmission, responding to calls means wearing their full face masks before even getting into the fire trucks.


“Thank God we didn’t have a lot of calls,” says Musseau.


Also still in the works is the department’s new smokehouse. Outside of the unforeseeable pandemic delays, the structure’s design is still undergoing changes and cost estimates as some materials are proving tricky to source.


“We haven’t finalized a plan of exactly what we want,” says Musseau. “We wanted something with cinderblock but apparently there’s nobody we can find who can come back and say the price to do a cinderblock house. We’re searching for other ideas.”


Once the plans are finalized, the new smokehouse will be constructed at the current training site which houses some old railcars. The cars will have to be removed and the ground landscaped before construction can even begin, which naturally affects the project’s overall budget.


Anyone who wants to submit their name to the list of candidates for the fire department are encouraged to pick up an application at the town office. Musseau says that the most important thing to keep in mind in that becoming a volunteer firefighter is the time required to train and to serve.


“It’s a big commitment to become a firefighter.”",

  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "PORT AUX BASQUES – The most recent meeting of Port aux Basques council took place on Monday, July 20. All councillors were in attendance, with proper social distancing measures in effect for members of council and the public. Here are the highlights.


Business owner Greg Sheaves gave a presentation where he reiterated concerns regarding backfilling issues in the Environmentally Protected (EP) zone along Grand Bay West. The current mapping proposal under the new town plan means he is unable to develop an area of land that he would like to and believes it does not actually interfere with the EP zone. Council informed him that he would likely have to apply for an exemption.


Council remains concerned about motorists speeding through town, particularly in the Grand Bay area. They are working with the Port aux Basques detachment of the RCMP to try to curb speeders.


The new municipal depot in the Grand Bay Industrial Park is nearing completion. Mayor John Spencer stated that he would like to see the new camera security system extended to keep an eye on people who are illegally dumping garbage in the cul-de-sac, as that area is usually a mess even shortly after cleanup.


There was also further discussion about garbage throughout the town. Improper trash storage, repeated littering, and refusal by some pet owners to clean up after their dogs is attracting more and more rats, which is in turn prompting more complaints to council. Mayor Spencer would like to see the town’s garbage cans assessed to determine that they all have cans and proper liners.


A petition by cat rescue group In Memory of Shadow to continue its shelter in part of the town industrial space (old fish plan) past the Oct. 31 deadline was denied. Deputy Mayor Todd Strickland pointed out that housing the cats in that space was only supposed to be temporary, and that unfortunately that fact may have been forgotten in the interim. Without going into specifics, council indicated that there were other business endeavours setting up in that space and that the shelter would unfortunately have to find an alternative space by the eviction deadline.


The Grand Bay West trail still needs some repair and maintenance. Council is also toying with the idea of putting an access point to the trail from the Hopedale cul-de-sac near the new municipal depot.

  title: "Tourism drops but outfitter remains optimistic",
  subtitles: "Chris Farrell of Margaree Outfitters has been feeling the COVID-19 crunch. - © J. Rene Roy",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "Chris Farrell estimates that he’s lost about 75 percent of his tourism business thanks to the pandemic. The owner of Margaree Outfitters is currently in his fifth year of operation, which is turning out to be his most challenging one yet, including his first summer on the water.


Although the Southwest Coast hasn’t reported a single case of COVID-19, the provincial health authorities prohibited non-residents from entering, which effectively derailed the tourist season. Prior to the pandemic, Farrell says he was booked solid, but soon began receiving phone calls, emails and social media message cancellations.


“They’ll rebook when everything gets straightened out,” he shrugs. “I’ve got duck hunters booked for 2022.”


Margaree Outfitters offers eider sea duck hunting, cod jigging, shark fishing and boat tours to nearby historic fishing villages. Business has grown consistently enough that Farrell was able to buy a new boat in anticipation of this summer’s tourist season, a 23-foot cabin cruiser called the Jeremiah.


“The duck hunting has been the big thing for me, more than the cod fishing or the boat tours I find,” says Farrell.


He is standing dockside on a mid-morning Sunday, awaiting his second and last couple of fishers for the day, who will bring the entire weekend’s scheduled bookings to a grand total of five people.


The provincial government’s attempt to help by promoting staycation opportunities to Newfoundlanders doesn’t seem to be helping either. Farrell says he’s seen no increase in local traffic, and even the opening of the Atlantic bubble isn’t making a noticeable difference.


“No. I haven’t really had anybody this summer,” he admits. “Every other summer, I’d come here, some days I didn’t know how I was going to fit everybody in.”


Like other tourism based operators, Farrell has taken advantage of a government subsidy program to stay in business until the tourists can come back. He hopes to salvage the fall duck hunting season, or at least some portion of it.


“I’ve still got quite a few bookings for this winter,” says Farrell, pausing for a moment. “But like I said, we don’t know how much worse this is going to get.”


Despite the setback, Farrell is perhaps one of the luckier ones. He still takes out a few locals or tourists when he can, and spends days just enjoying his own boat out on the water. Meanwhile only a short jaunt down the coast to Rose Blanche - Harbour Le Cou reveals that the historic lighthouse attraction remains closed for the season.


“I was talking to a couple of people I had out. They were down the East Coast. They said there were a lot of places not even open. There’s not enough business to have it open,” says Farrell. “Could be years before this all gets going again.”",

  subtitles: "The historic lighthouse at Rose Blanche - Harbour Le Cou remains closed due to COVID-19. - © J. Rene Roy",
  author: "Wreckhouse Weekly",
  body: "The town council of Rose Blanche - Harbour Le Cou has been busy even in the wake of COVID-19. Here are some of the highlights of their meetings from Jan. to June 2020.


In January, the town Recreation Committee asked to meet with members to discuss the town’s upcoming 50th anniversary next year. Due to COVID-19 the event is currently on hold, but will be re-addressed next year. Some kind of event may still take place, but it’s unlikely to be as big as what the town was originally hoping to host.


There was also concern about ambulance response being unable to get to town during storms. Council reached out to MHA Andrew Parsons and the Department of Transportation and Works to see what could be done to make sure local emergency services can respond to an emergency situation despite weather conditions.


In February council received communication by an unnamed company expressing potential interest in the quartz mine located in Diamond Cove. Council intended to reach out to the local service district at Diamond Cove, but after checking with the Department of Mines, Lands and Natural Resources felt it was way too early to determine anything. Should the company continue to express interest, council will invite them to a meeting with all parties, but to date no further communication has taken place.


At the April meeting, council noted that there was a great deal of garbage and other debris being improperly discarded around town, especially on parking areas such as the one at the historic lighthouse site. Public notices were planned to advise people that littering is prohibited, and that illegal dumping can lead to charges.


In May, Mayor Clayton Durnford reported that residents were bringing forth concerns about seasonal residents. People were informed that exemptions are the purview of the provincial health authorities and that residents not following the guidelines must report it to the province rather than the town.


Harbour Authority began installing signage to let docking vessels know that if they were coming from out of province they would not be permitted onshore, though they would be supplied water. Any persons onboard an out of province vessel were obliged to follow Provincial Health Guidelines and remain onboard to comply with mandatory self-isolation regulations. To date the town has only had one ship visit and it was a Newfoundland vessel.

At the June meeting it was noted that the historic lighthouse and guest kiosks would remain closed for the summer season due to COVID-19 concerns, however the gate remained opened so that visitors could continue to walk the trail.


The Recreation Committee advised that the playground was reopened until 8 p.m. with a student taking care of the daily cleaning. Social distancing guidelines were also posted at the area and on the town’s social media page.


Given that home assessments are down across the entire province, there was some concern noted about the upcoming budget.


The annual firefighter’s ball that had originally been scheduled for Sept. 19 has been postponed and no new date has yet been determined.
